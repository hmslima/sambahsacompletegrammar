INTRODUCTION
============

**Sambahsa Mundialect** is an auxiliary language created by the french
Dr. Olivier Simon, it was launched in the internet on July of 2007, its
base is the proto-indo-european language, language spoken about 5000
years ago, whose daughter languages widespread from Southern Russia up
to the British Isles and to India. Sambahsa counts with many
contributions from another languages, especially arabic, but also
chinese, indonesian and many others.

Being an auxiliary language, sambahsa is much more easier than any
national language like german or spanish, but sambahsa is a bit more
difficult if compared to other auxiliary languages because of show
itself as complicated in the start, but after that the learning process
show itself incredibly simple.

With what the language looks alike? The interesting of sambahsa is that
you don't see it as a constructed language, but as a national language
like any other. As Dave MacLeod has said in his preface for the book
*The Grammar Of Sambahsa-Mundialect In English*, “I always imagined
Sambahsa to be an example of a language that could have existed
somewhere around present-day Armenia, where a kingdom using a descendant
of Proto-Indo-European using it has been influenced over the centuries
by its Persian, Turkish and Arab neighbors, as well as various countries
from the east. At times it feels a bit like Bulgarian, at other times
like Persian, and sometimes similar to German as well”.

It's not official, but may be said that sambahsa has a flag for
represent it. Actually the flag just after was made to represent all
speaker of indo-european languages, but the sambahsa movement kinda have
adopted the flag for itself.

The brown color represents the ground, since many indo-european
languages derive their words for “person” from words related to clay,
like the word “earthling”. The white color was chosen because of it
contrasts the better. The reason the symbol is the wheel is because it
is an important inovation made by humans, and, anyway, it's an important
symbol for almost all indo-europeans anyhow

The movement that supports sambahsa is not linked to any kind of
thought: people from all kinds, ethnicity, places, believes and
ideologies may use the language as they please.

As was said, this grammar is free, because it is under the license
Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0, you may modify it as you want and even use
it for commercial purposes. You may also use this book to make your own
version of the sambahsa's grammar and even sell it in the market of your
city, if you want. Your only obligation is to attribute the due credit
to original author, I hope it's not much to ask.

The objective of this grammar is to teach everything what is the
interest of the student in the most possible friendly way, if it is not
possible in the current grammar's version you're reading, we hope to
reach something near in future versions. Notice that this is a
“*complete* grammar”, this “complete” is not a mere decoration like in
other grammars, it means that I’ll approach all points to you finish
this grammar knowing (almost) everything, so don’t be afraid if you
think, for example, that the chapter about phonetics is overly large. We
can't create the perfect grammar, but we will try to do the best.

WHY LEARN AN AUXILIARY LANGUAGE?
--------------------------------

You as me: “but we already have english as an international language,
why learn an artificial language?”. Before answer this question, I must
remember that I am speaking about a language for a world context, if
I'll work in China or, at least, stay in touch with chineses, I will
have to learn mandarin or cantonese, it's obvious. What I am talking
about here is: if I enter in a room where there are a paquistanese, a
russian, a brazilian, an argentinian and a japanese, all of them only
could have a communication if they know a common language, because of
are few they who have time and disposition to learn five different
languages; in current days it's expected that all these people speak
english for making possible a communication. This is the X of the
question.

The problem with a national language – no matter whether it is english,
spanish, french or mandarin – is that it's spent much time *(also money
in many cases)* learning it. Of course that for those who like to learn
languages or will live in a foreign country, it's a **fabulous**
investment, even learning a “less important” language is a good
investment if it pleases you and it may be a professional differential
in the future. But when the matter is a language that serve as bridge
between different people, the scenario is different.

I like to say that two peoples communicate with other through the
[]{#anchor-1}language of a determined country is is like calculate using
roman numerals. It's perfectly possible calculate with this numerals,
peoples did that for centuries (!!), but it's much more efficient to
calculate with indo-arabic numerals, that in our case would be a
language that you learn in months instead one you learn in years and is
fully of traps. I said “language of a determined country” because of
people learn – in the international communication scope – the english
variant from United States of America or England, but never the english
from Jamaica)

Other negative point in using the language of another country as
international language is that, somewhat, corroborate the supremacy of
this country. In the modern times was used french because of France was
the most influential nation of Europe, since the XX century we use
english because of the anglophone countries acquire great economic and
military power. Do some decades hence we will have to communicate with
each other in mandarin or in the language of the country that “rules”
the world.

### SO ARE YOU AGAINST THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

My answer to this question is a loud “**NO**”! English is considered as
official language in countries of all the continents, not to mention
that the United States and England are great exporters of culture, it’s
because of this and other factors that many people support the idea that
english still will be used as lingua franca even when the United States
lose its hegemony. And personally I think that english is a very
beautiful language.

Despite all the critics made, english still is the most widespread
language in the globe, in practically all schools of the world with a
minimal of infrastructure the english language is taught; unlike
english, no auxiliary language had the support of a State and companies
to propagate it on the world. When I started this grammar I only knew
portuguese, my mother tongue, and I had some reasonable knowledge of english and
esperanto; when I meet sambahsa there were only a grammar in french, the
mother tongue of the creator of sambahsa, and in english. Thanks to the
english I could start my studies of sambahsa and then make this grammar.
I work in favor to auxiliary languages like sambahsa and esperanto
because I judge languages like these more efficient than national
languages, but we know that currently a work will be much better exposed
if it is made in english.

For example, the original version of this grammar, which is in brazilian
portuguese, only will be useful for lusophones (brazilians, portugueses,
mozambicans, etc) and **maybe** to a very few of curious people who had
decided to learn portuguese; but this version in english is useful to
russophones, hispanophones, francophones, nipophones, sinophones,
germanophones, italophones and many others who has a good knowledge of
english, because of probably they live in a country where the english is
taught in the schools. But I hope that these people translate this grammar to their respective languages.

Some may think that I contradict everything what was said in the previous
sub-chapters and I am praising the english language, but it’s not the
case, I am only being realist, I only recognize the advances of the
current model as well as I pointed some of its deficiencies, I still
defend the use of auxiliary languages. It’s important to learn english
just as is important to learn spanish, russian, esperanto, mandarin,
etc, because although we defend that use an auxiliary language as lingua
franca would be much more efficient, I say that the true international
language is the polyglotism, if you want to be something near to a true
“citizen of the world”, be a polyglot!

BUT WHY LEARN SAMBAHSA?
-----------------------

Before I meet sambahsa I've already known other auxiliary languages, but
I was not fully satisfied with them, not because they are inefficient or
ugly, but they have certain aspects, due their simplicity, that
displeased me.

Sambahsa have success in having the regularity – and facility – of an
auxiliary language and the naturality and native beauty of a national
language. Sambahsa is as good as portuguese or english for making poetry
and the imported proper nouns from other languages don't need, in most
cases, to have its spelling or pronounce changed to adequate the
standards of the language, the “problems” of importing these proper
nouns will be the same that occurs in any national language.

For not having 100 years as other auxiliary languages, sambahsa doesn't
have a community with thousand of speakers yet, but this scenario can
change, every auxiliary language started with only one person, but can
exist thousands of speakers if more people get interested for the
language

IS SAMBAHSA DIFFICULT?
----------------------

It's undeniable that in the **beginning** sambahsa is more challenging
if it is compared to other auxiliary languages, but it's like Robert
Winter said in his “Sambahsa: Guide to Pronouns and Articles”,
*“sambahsa is right on the limit of the degree of difficulty that is
practical for an international auxiliary language”*.

The differential of sambahsa is that, even being an auxiliary language,
it behave well as a natural language *(I don't like this term, but it
was the description that I thought to explain it)*.

Sambahsa indeed is easy, you only have to know what are you priorities
of study, *you have to know how to study*! Doesn't make sense decorate
all declinative cases from dative if you use them a very few times (and
maybe only a few of them, even you only use sambahsa in all days of your
life)! Also it's necessary have in mind that it's not because it is an
easy language you will be writing philosophical treatises in three
weeks, but maybe you can do it in six or eight months.

Also people say that the language is excessively prolix, sometimes
having two or three invariable words for each one of the same type in
our language. Really sambahsa doesn't economize in its invariable words,
a prolix language like sambahsa pays the price of demanding a bit more
of study, but, by contrast, it allows the best expression of thought.

**Everything has a price:** many auxiliary languages try to be the possible
simplest ones, adopting, for example, very simple orthographies: one
letter, one sound; all nouns have only one ending, all adjectives have
only one ending, etc. The advantage of not having a too complex
orthography is that the learning curve is very low, but the disadvantage
is that from this is created a little problem with importation of words
of other languages, which will have to be drastically modified *(as in
orthography as in pronounce)* for being according to the language's
rules. Other problem of a simple orthography is the little freedom for
the creation of poesy and music. I am not saying that very simple
auxiliary languages are ugly, since it's very subjective and a person
with a crystalline voice and talent can create the best song of the
world through the simplest and “ugliest” language. What I am saying is
that it's paid a price for the excess of simplification, and the
contrary is true too, it's paid a price to avoid all these problems of
the simple languages. The question is, what is the price you are willing
to pay?

Many complain that very simple auxiliary languages offers little poetic
freedom, others will say that more complex auxiliary languages are
unnecessarily more difficult.

METHODOLOGY OF TEACHING
=======================

I structured the grammar in the following way: I avoid the presentation
of a new content that demands the previous knowledge of other
no-mentioned subject, for example: if for learning the future verbal
tense is necessary to know the infinitive, I will teach the infinitive
before; if for learning the declination is necessary some basic grammar
knowledge, I will bring back those teachings from middle school's
classes. I believe that this way is the less annoying for the beginner.

This book was made in the way that it serves the student with no any
previous knowledge, in other words, I am assuming you don't know another
language and even you don't know certain basic grammar terms. Thus a
student can read this grammar without the necessity of consulting other
book, except dictionaries. *The goal of this grammar is to be accessible
to everyone*.

**What I am going to say is important, so pay attention!** When you
study, don't be in a hurry for decorating all cases in the accusative or
all the list of prepositions once, take it easy, since you will use some
words more times than other ones. No grammar was made to be read just
once, but many times. Now you are starting, read the chapters only once,
twice at most, then go on to the next chapter. After finishing the
reading of the grammar, start reading texts, they will help you to
increase your vocabulary and improve you grammar knowledge, since you
will have to consult the grammar for understanding how that sentence was
made.

It can seem strange, but I started this grammar when I was in the
beginning of my studies in the language, in my second or third week of
learning, not when I already had a good mastering over sambahsa. I had
two reasons to do that: the act of made a grammar demands a great
responsibility, what boosted me in my studies, thanks to this work I
could learn things more quickly, that was a very interesting exercise;
the second reason is that the person who knows the first difficulties of
a beginner is other beginner, if I had to make this grammar much time
after, maybe I could forget certain difficulties I had and I wouldn't
address them in this grammar.

ACTUALLY YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN EVERYTHING
-------------------------------------------

One of the goals of this grammar is being the most complete as possible,
in other words, the goal is to cover the most basic until the elements
that will only rarely appear in the most erudite literature. There will
be things here optional forms of the indicative of present, that rarely
are used, but this grammar has the obligation of presenting. Focus only
in what is necessary for you!

The language also has a very rich phonology, there are sounds that
doesn't exist in english, but can be learned in a short time. I made the
possible to explain the sounds, since per comparisons with other
languages until per what movements of tongue and mouth are made. But if
you really have difficulty with some sounds, there is no problem, you
can use a similar sound, very improbably someone you don't understand
you, but endeavor a bit for learning all sounds, it'll be a learning
that will serve for other languages as you will see.

TIPS FOR STUDYING A LANGUAGE
----------------------------

In these years studying languages I've learned some things, they are
tips that are useful for any language, not only sambahsa:

-   When you read, listen, write or say a word, directly associate this
    word to its idea. I'll explain: some people, when read “nebh”,
    associate this word to portuguese word “cloud” and then they make
    association to a cloud. Don't do this, train your mind to don't need
    an intermediate, try to directly associate the word to the idea or
    object.
-   Don't stick to the grammar, read the grammar once or twice then go
    to the texts, you have to see the language in the practice. With the
    time you will absorb the grammar rules while acquire vocabulary.
    When, in a text, you don't know how certain grammatical construction
    was made, you come back to the grammar.
-   Use the language since the first day. Even that only in your mind,
    give a “good morning” in sambahsa, create simple sentences for daily
    situations. Try to use the language in the beginning as possible,
    even you don't know the most basic prepositions.

ALPHABET AND PRONUNCIATION
==========================

Maybe you take fright because of the size of this chapter, indeed it is
a bit big if compared to other grammars in their chapters of alphabet
and pronunciation, but it's for a good reason. In the study of a
language, the first thing you have to learn are the sounds, it's
important that, by learning a new word, you store it in you memory with
the correct pronunciation, that's why I will not spare explanations in
this chapter.

The alphabet is composed by 26 latin letters, they are: a, b, c, d, e,
f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The
orthography is a bit complex, but still regular.

For represent the sounds there is the *Sambahsa Phonetic Transcription*
(SPT), an alphabet whose words are always between curly brackets { } in
all of this grammar, the letters in UPPERCASE inside the brackets
represent the accentuated syllables and a colon (:) informs that the
vowel before that is lengthened. Be aware that the explanations about
pronunciation are based in the american version of english.

Initially the SPT was made between square brackets \[ \], but I've
choosen curly brackets { } because the square brackets already are used
by the international phonetic alphabet that I'll talk soon after.

In addiction there is something called *International Phonetic Alphabet*
(IPA), it's like the SPT, but it's used in all the world. The letters of
this alphabet always will lie inside slashes / / or square brackets \[
\] in this grammar. I will use the IPA to explain the SPT, because if
you have access to the sounds of the IPA, you have a secure source of
how the sambahsa sounds are pronounced. **But throughout the grammar,
outside the “alphabet and pronunciation” chapter, I'll only practically
use SPT!**

The difference between slashes and square brackets in IPA is that the
slashes indicate a more simple transcription while square brackets
indicate a more precise transcription.

You ask me: why we don't only use IPA if this one is official and more
known while SPT only applies to sambahsa? There are two reasons:

-   SPT is easer to type in computers, what facilitates when someone
    wanna explain the pronunciation in internet or in any typed work.
-   Sambahsa was made for people of all the world, one letter of SPT can
    encompass several similar sounds of IPA, thus there wont unnecessary
    effort to people of diverse backgrounds pronounce sambahsa words.
    For example: {r} refers, preferably, the sounds /ʀ/ and /r/, but it
    also can refers to the sound /ɾ/, which occurs in th american
    english.

Before we go on, some observations:

-   Probably many sounds here will be new for you. Don't worry, all the
    sounds not found in the english language will be explained with all
    details as possible.
-   This grammar is useful for all who knows english, but the phonetic
    descriptions were based on the american english.
-   The United States of America is a continental country and have some
    linguistic variation. So, if you find that the phonetic description
    of a word is unfamiliar, maybe I am referring to the way of speaking
    of other part of the United States.
-   Sambahsa is very rich in what concerns to sounds, if you find that
    some sound is very complicate, you can use a similar sound in its
    place if you think that the meaning of the word will not be twisted
    and make confusion in the conversation. The important is that you
    use sambahsa!
-   You don't need to use IPA if you don't want, since all the sounds
    will be explained. The AFI is there for serving as additional
    resource for you.
-   Even you have never heard about IPA, you can easily use it. There
    are many resources that shows the sounds of the IPA and some ones
    even teaches you how to do them. Copy and paste the IPA letter that
    you want to learn in your favorite search engine, then see the
    options of websites and files that treats about the pronunciation of
    these sounds. It's not so difficult.

    -   As I've said before: the IPA practically only will be used in
        this “alphabet and pronunciation” chapter, in the rest of the
        book I will use only SPT! The IPA is only a secure guide for you
        learning SPT, which is important!

-   If the IPA and SPT wont be clear for you, I put some words from our
    english language transcribed in these alphabets to you comprehend
    them well.

**{a} –** /a/ – something like the first part of “i” in “h**i**de” or
“br**i**de”, whose sound actually is /a[]{#anchor-3}ɪ/,
[]{#anchor-4}[]{#anchor-5}but without the second part /…ɪ/.
[]{#anchor-6}Pay attention that {a} is not like the “a” in “f**a**ther”
or “**a**rm”, whose “a” is /ɑː/. It's like the “a” in the french word
“p**a**tte” or in the eastern andalusian spanish “m**a**dres”

**{ä} –** /ɛ/ – like “e” in “dr**e**ss” and “m**e**t” or “ae” in
“br**ea**d”.

**{b} –** /b/ – like “b” in “**b**ad”.

**{c} –** /ʃ/ – like “sh” in “**sh**oe” or “cra**sh**”.

**{d} –** /d/ – like “d” in “**d**ay”.

**{e} –** /e/ – something like the first part of “a” in “l**a**ke”, “ai”
in “p**ai**d” or “ei” in “r**ei**n”, whose sound actually is /eɪ/, but
without the second part /…ɪ/. It's like the “é” in the french word
“beaut**é**” or the “ee” in the standard german “S**ee**le”.

**{ë} –** /ə/ – like “e” in “fath**e**r”, “a” in “**a**gain” or “u” in
“syr**u**p”.

**{f} –** /f/ – like “f” in “**f**ather”.

**{g} –** /g/ – like “g” in “**g**irl” or “**g**oat”.

**{h} –** /h/ – like “h” in “**h**orse”

**{i} –** /i/ – like “y” in “happ**y**”, “ey” in “mon**ey**” or “ie” in
“part**ie**s”.

**{j} –** /[]{#anchor-7}ʒ/ – like “s” “vi**s**ion” or “a**s**ian”

**{k} –** /k/ – like “c” in “**c**ut”, “ck” in “ba**ck**” or “k” in
“spea**k**”

**{l} –** /l/ – like “l” in “**l**eft” or “sou**l**”.

**{m} –** /m/ – like “m” in “**m**other”.

**{n} –** /n/ – like “n” in “**n**ight”

**{o} –** /o/ or /ɔ/ – the /o/ sound is something like the fist part of
“o” in “g**o**at”, whose sound actually is /o[]{#anchor-8}ʊ/, but
without the second part /…ʊ/. It's like the “eau” in the french word
“rés**eau**” or the “o” in the standard german word “**o**der”. The /ɔ/
sound is found in “o” of “n**o**rth”.

**{ö} –** /ø/ – like the “ö” from german or the “eux” french.
[]{#anchor-9}[]{#anchor-10}[]{#anchor-11}Don't you know german neither
french? []{#anchor-12}There is no problem, I teach you how to made this
sound. It's how you make the {e} sound, but with the mouth in the form
you make the {o} sound, in other words, speak /e/ with the puckered
lips.

**{p} –** /p/ – like “p” in “**p**each”.

**{q} –** /x/ – like the german “ach-laut” or like “j” in the spanish
word “**j**ota”. Don't you know german neither spanish? There is no
problem, I teach you how to made this sound. It's like the {h} sound,
but the sound comes scraping the final of your throat; think in a
vintage kettle.

**{r} –** /[]{#anchor-13}ʀ/ – in situations like in “radh”, “prete” and
“accurat”, where after “r” there is a vowel, you can pronunciate it as
the “r” in “**r**ed”. Actually sambahsa admits a wide variety of sounds
– includding our “r” (!!!!!) –, but *if* it’s for elect an official
sound, it should be the uvular “r” (/ʀ/) from german.
[]{#anchor-14}Don't you know germa? []{#anchor-15}There is no problem, I
teach you how to made this sound. Do the following exercise, gargle
water (or any other liquid). Through this simple exercise you start to
understand how to vibrate your uvula.

**{r} –** /[]{#anchor-16}ʁ/ – in situations like in “irk”, “amor” and
“absorb”, where after “r” there isn't a consonant or this “r” is the
last letter of the word, this consonant assumes the sound \[ʁ\]. The /ʁ/
is very similar the sound /h/ of “**h**orse”, but there are two
differences, you must vibrate your vocal cords like you do in {d} or {n}
and the place of articulation of /[]{#anchor-17}ʁ/ is the uvula – while
the place of articulation of /h/ is the glottis –, in other words, you
must articulate the back of your tongue at the uvula. Just below some
examples in IPA:

spar – /spaʁ/

cherkin – /t͡ʃəʁ'kin/

wir – /wiʁ/

clever – /'klevəʁ/

cort – /koʁt/

amor – /a'moʁ/

cort – /koʁt/

aur – /'aʊʁ/

mer – /meʁ/

air – /ɛʁ/

atelier – /ate'ljeʁ/

ier – /jeʁ/

ierk – /jeʁk/

piurn – /pjuʁn/

oyr – /ojʁ/

ayr – /ajʁ/

butour – /bu'tuːʁ/

alabster – /a'labstəʁ/

gurgule – /'guʁgyl/

eurp – /øʁp/

arbust – /aʁ'bust/

ender – /'endəʁ/

biaur – /bj'aʊʁ/

**{s} **– /s/ – like “s” in “**s**ound” or “c” in “ri**c**e”.

**{t} –** /t/ – like “t” in “**t**o**t**al”.

**{u} –** /u/ – like “oo” in “l**oo**se”.

**{ü} –** /y/ – like the french “u” or the german “ü”.
[]{#anchor-18}[]{#anchor-19}Don't you know german neither french?
[]{#anchor-20}There is no problem, I teach you how to made this sound.
It's very simple, speak the {u} sound, notice the movements you do with
your mouth; now speak the sound {i}, but with the mouth movement of {u},
in other words, speak {i} with a puckered lips.

**{v} **– /v/ – like “v” in “**v**ein”.

**{w} –** /w/ – like “w” in “**w**ater”, but it's *not* like “w” in
“sho**w**”, which is /ʊ/.

**{x} –** /ç/ – like the german “ich-laut” or, perhaps, “h” in
“**h**uman”. []{#anchor-21}Don't you know german? []{#anchor-22}There is
no problem, I teach you how to made this sound. Articulate your mouth in
order it is in the way you speak the vowel {i}, notice that in this
position the body of your tongue almost touch your palate and the tip of
your tongue touches the inferior teeth of the front, then expire as you
do when you pronounce {c}, but be careful for you don't rise the tongue.

**{y} –** /j/ – like “y” in “**y**ou” or the first part of “u” in
“t**u**be” /t**j**u:b/.

**{z} –** /z/ – like “z” in “**z**ap”.

**{§} –** /θ/ – like “th” in “bir**th**day” or “**th**in”, but *not*
like in “**th**is” or “wor**th**” whose sound is /ð/.

**{tc} –** /[]{#anchor-23}t͡ʃ/ – like “ch” in “whi**ch**” or “**ch**eap”

**{dj} –** /[]{#anchor-24}d͡ʒ/ – like “g” in “hu**g**e” or “j” in
“**j**ump”

**{ng} –** /nj/ or /[]{#anchor-25}ŋ/ – like “ng” in “thi**ng**” or
“ki**ng**”, whose sound is /[]{#anchor-26}ŋ/, but *not* like the “n” in
“thi**n**” or “ki**n**”.

**{nk} –** /ŋk/

I suggest that you really learn the SPT before move on. Because of this
is a very important part, I suggest that you make an exception and read
this chapter more than twice, I need that you know it very well.

SOME ENGLISH WORDS IN IPA AND SPT
---------------------------------

Do you remember that I promised the transcription of some word of ours
to IPA and SPT? If you reached here without understanding very well both
alphabets, let's see whether with the list below you understand them.
Deliberately I've inserted some words whose sounds don’t exist in
sambahsa, I did this to make you pay attention to the differences
between the two languages, in these cases there wont a transcription to
SPT.

For you don't being lost, firstly I show the word, then the
transcription to IPA, which is between slashes, and then the
transcription in SPT, which is between brackets.

**Beach** – /bi:tʃ/ – {bi:tc}

**Men –** /mɛn/ – {män}

**Man –** /mæn/ – {män} *({*ä*} would be /*ɛ*/, but I think that I can
representate /*æ*/ as {*ä*})*

**Bra –** /bɹɑː/ – {bra} *({*a*} would be /*a*/, but I think that I can
representate /*ɑ*/ as {*a*})*

**Food –** /fu:d/ – {fu:d}

**Cute –** /kjut/ – {kyut}

**Sea –** /si:/ – {si:}

**Fill **– /fɪl/ – {fil} *({*i*} would be /*i*/, but I think that I can
representate /*ɪ*/ as {*i*})*

**Boat –** /boʊt/ – {bowt} *({*u*} would be /*u*/, but I think that I
can representate /*ʊ*/ as *{u})

**Dog –** /dɔg/ – {dog} *(notice in this example and in the example just
above that /*o*/ and /*ɔ*/ are both represented as {*o*}, yeah, {*o*}
can mean both sounds)*

**Girl –** /gɜɹl/ – *(the sound /*ɜ*/ doesn't exist in sambahsa and
/*ɹ*/ is a sound that should be avoided)*

**Extra – **/ˈɛkstɹə/ – {Äkstrë} *(but you still can represent /*ɹ*/ as
{*r*})*

**About –** /əˌbaʊd/ – {ëbAod}

**Excuse *****(noun)***** – **/ɪkˈskjus/ – {ik skyUs}

**Where are you going –** /ˈwɛəɹ‿əɹ ju ˈgoʊɪŋ/

**Keep –** /kip/ – {kip}

**Each –** /itʃ/ – {itc}

**Father –** /fɑðəɹ/ – (*the sound /ð/ doesn't exist in sambahsa*)

**Again –** /əˈgɛn/ – {ëgÄn}

**Blackout –** /ˈblækˌaʊt|/ – {bläkAwt}

**Sound –** /saʊnd/ – {sAond}

**Thief –** /θif/ – {§if}

**Tomorrow –** /təˈmɑɹoʊ/ – {tëmArow}

**She –** /ʃi/ – {ci}

**When –** /wɛn/ – {wän}

**Now – **/naʊ/ – {nAo}

It’s good to remember that the letter {r} from SPT can assume various
sounds, like /r/, /ɾ/, /ʁ/, /ʀ/ and /ɹ/.

A LAST VISIT TO THE ALPHABET AND THE NAME OF THE LANGUAGE
---------------------------------------------------------

Now that you alread know SPT, let's go back to the alphabet for you know
how each letter is pronounced:

a {a}, b {be}, c {tse}, d {de}, e {e}, f {ef}, g {dje}, h {hatc}, i {i},
j {jye}, k {ka}, l {el}, m {em}, n {en}, o {o}, p {pe}, q {ku}, r {er},
s {es}, t {te}, u {u}, v {ve}, w {we}, x {iks}, y {ü}, z {dzed}

Before we go on, it's important to know how our language is pronounced!

**Sambahsa Mundialect –** {sambA:sa mundyAlëkt}

WE ARE NOT FINISHED YET, SOME CONVENTIONS
-----------------------------------------

**Before we go on, a warning: **don't worry, initially, with the more
complex grammar rules, because of I'll be showing the pronounce of each
example during a good time here, so you'll naturally learn the
pronunciation. *Don't decore anything, understand it*! My advice is:
read this part once or twice – at most – then go on with your studies.
Does the orthography is this so difficult? No, but it can be boring at
the beginning for those who are starting and it is, in my personal
opinion, obligatory at the beginning since I'll dispose the
pronunciation with the examples.

Since here until the final of the **ALPHABET AND PRONUNCIATION**
chapter, the text will be almost a transcription of the book *The
Grammar Of Sambahsa-Mundialect In English*, of Dr. Olivier Simon.

The vowels are represented by V, they are: “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”. The
semivowels are “w” and “y”, they are represented by C, as well as the
consonants.

### THE LETTER “e”:

When it is the stressed []{#anchor-27}syllable or the first letter of
the word, it's pronounced as {e}.

**incandescent {inkandEsënt} –** incandescent

**emigrant {emigrAnt} –** emigrant

It's not pronounced when alone in the final of a word…

**monte {mont} –** mount *(an animal)*

**claviature {klavyatÜr} –** keyboard

[]{#anchor-28}**clientele {klyentEl} – **customers

… or at the end of a word before the letters “s” and “t”.

**crimes {krims} – **crimes

**survivet {survIvd} –** *(he/she/it)* survives

In some cases the loss of “e” can create a confusion or make the word
unpronounceable, in these cases “e” assumes the sound {ë}.

[]{#anchor-29}**storgnet {stOrnyët} –** stunned

*Why do “gn” of “storgnet” is pronounced as {ny}? I explain it later.*

All words finished in “quet” and “ques” are pronounced, respectively”,
as {kët} e {kës}.

In all the other cases “e” has the {ë} sound, like in “kohlen”, which is
pronounced as {kO:lën}.

*Why do the pronounce of “o” is lengthened in this word? This I am going
to answer you.*

### THE LETTER “h”:

It has the {h} sound when at the beginning of a word or between vowels.

**habe {hab} –** have

**rahat {rahAt} –** rest

[]{#anchor-30}When the letter “h” is after a vowel and is not followed
by no other vowel, the letter “h” serves to indicate that the
pronunciation of the vowel must be lengthened.

[]{#anchor-31}**kohlen {kO:lën} –** hiden

**bahsa {bA:sa} –** language

**bah {ba:} –** to say, to speak

Maybe you ask me: “don't would be much more simple to write the vowel
twice to indicate the lengthened of its pronounce? Instead to write
'bahsa', would be much more simpler to write 'baasa'?”

**The answer is:** No! This would produce a different sound, “baasa”
would be pronounced as {baAza}

“gh”, “bh” e “dh” respectively correspond to {g}, {b} and {d}, the “h”
in these letters serves to indicate that they will not suffer any kind
of modification.

VOWELS
------

**“eau” {o:} –** /o:/ like in “bureau” {bürO:} *(bureau, office)*

**“aa” {aA} –** /a'a/ – like in “saat” {saAt} *(hour, clock, watch)*

**“ae”, “ae” {ay} –** /aj/ – like “[]{#anchor-32}yoinkjiae” {yoynkjiAy}
*(musical scale)*

**“ai” {ä} –** like in “caise” {käz} *(queijo)*

/'ea/ – like in “wakea” {wakEa} *(definitely)*

**“ea” {ëa} *****(at the end of a word)***** –** /əa/ – like in “ocean”
{ots(ë)An} *(ocean) Notice that as the sounds {ë} and {a} aresimilar, in
practice the “e”, in this case, normally ends being absorbed, in other
words, it is not pronounced. In this case, any final consonant - except "s" - shifts the stress on "a", and leads to that pronunciation different from "wakea".*

**“ee” {Eë} –** /eə/ – like in “eet” {Eët} *(*(he/she/it)* was)*

**“eo” {Eo} –** \[eʊ̯\] – like in “fianceo” {fyantsEo} *(fiance)*

**“eu” {ö} –** like in “Europe” {örOp} *(Europa)*

**“ie” {i:} *****(when alone at the end of a word***** –** like in
“publie” {publI:} *(publish)*

**“ie” {ye} *****(in all the other casees)***** –** /je/ – like in
“publiet” {publyEt} *(published)*

**“iu” {yu} –** /ju/ – like “iu” in “siuk” {syuk} *(dry)*

**“uy” {uy} –** /uj/ – like in “[]{#anchor-36}lastruym” {lastrUym}
*(hold *(boat)*)*

**“u” {u} *****(“u” has the sound {u}, but it would be {ü} if there is
the letter “e” between the two following letters)***** –** like in “bur”
{bur} *(ashes)*, but “bureau” is {bürO:}.

SEMIVOWELS
----------

“w” and “y” respectively are {w} and {y} when combined to vowel, but
when isolates the letter “w” is pronounced like a short {u} and “y” like
{ü}.

[]{#anchor-37}**sehkwnt {sE:kunt} –** (they) follow

**type {tüp} –** guy; type

But when the letter “y” finds itself at the final of a word or followed
by a -s, “y” e “ys” respectively will have the sounds {i} and {is}.

**baby {bAbi} – **baby

**babys {bAbis} –** babies

CONSONANTS
----------

**“sch” {c} –** like in “[]{#anchor-38}muraischmusch” {muräcmUc} *(mush
fly)*

**“kh” {q} –** like in “khiter” {qItër} *(evil)*

**“ph” {f} –** like in “philosophia” {filozOfya} *(philosophy)*

**“qu” {kw} *****(when before “a”, “o” e “u”, or {k} when before “e”,
“i” e “y”)***** –** \[kw\] or \[kʷ\] – like in “quod” {kwod} *(what)*
and “quis” {kis} *(who)*.

**“sc” {sk} *****(it's {s} when before “e”, “i” e “y”)***** –** “scutt”
{skut} *(shake)* and “science” {syents} *(science)*

**“sh” {x} –** like in “[]{#anchor-39}shienciu” {xyEntsyu} *(overgrown)*

**“ss” {s} –** like in “permission” {përmisyOn} *(permission)*

**“th” {§} *****(it's{t} when combined with {s}, {c} or {j} *****) –**
like in “[]{#anchor-40}thamf” {§amf} *(stench)* and
“[]{#anchor-41}esthetic” {estEtik} (*aesthetical)*.

**“c” {k} *****(it's {ts} (/t͡s/) when before “e”, “i” e “y”)***** –**
clike in “condition” {kondityOn} *(condition)* and “petrificit”
{pëtrifItsit} *(petrified)*

**“g” {g} *****(it's {dj} when before “e”, “i” e “y”)***** –** like in
“gulf” {gulf} *(gulf)* and “large” {lardj} *(large)*.

**“j” {j} –** always {j}.

**“r” {r} –** as there are people from different backgrounds, it's
admited a wide variety of manners of how this sound is made, including
our “r”! The recommended form – but it's not compulsory – it's the way
spoken in Luxembourg or Saarland, /ʀ/. However this sound can take other
forms:

**“rr” /r(r)/ and “rh” /r(h)/ –** like the spanish “rr” (/r/).

**“rl” –** like the japanese “r” (/ɺ/), it may also be pronounced as
/rl/ or /ʁl/. Don't know japanese? There is no problem, I explain it:
notice where your tongue touches when you speaks the sound {d}. Did you
observe? You make the japanese “r” trying to make the /ɾ/ of
“be**tt**er”, but touching the tongue in the same place where you do
when you say {d} and you must hold your tongue during a tiny bit in
order to the air passes at the laterals of your tongue instead of the
center of the tongue.

**“s” {s} *****({z} when between vowels)***** –** “son” {son} *(son)
and* “decision” {dëtsiziOn} *(decision)*

**“x” {ks} –** /k͡s/ – it may turn {gz}, if it facilitates the
pronunciation.

**“z” {dz} –** /d͡z/ – like in “[]{#anchor-42}zangir” {dzAndjir}
*(chain)*

MORE OBSERVATIONS
-----------------

Some letters, especially those at the end of the word, may be modified
by the neighbor sounds. Like in the case of “hands” {handz} (hands).

Some consonantes, as well as the vowel {ë}, may be omitted. The word
“franceois” officially is {frantsëOys}, but it may be {fransOys} because
of {t} is inside a consonanl group and the unstressed vowel {ë} is close
to the stressed vowel {o}.

If the verbal form starts with {s*C*}, oi- may be added before this word
for euphonic reasons. For example “skap”, which becomes “oiskap”.

STRESS ACCENT IN SAMBAHSA
-------------------------

[]{#anchor-43}Start analyzing the word since the last syllable

### ALWAYS RECEIVES ACCENTUATION

Vowels before the letter “h” or a double consonant (rr”, “ll”, “tt” …),
by double consonant also it's understood the “ck”{k(k)}. The same is
said about a syllable before a final -e. There some examples:

[]{#anchor-44}**Prodah –** {prodA:} *(hand over *(a criminal)*)\
*[]{#anchor-45}*F*[]{#anchor-46}*or you ro understand: if the word would
“proda”, *[]{#anchor-47}*the pronunciation would be {prOda}*

[]{#anchor-48}**Recess –** {rëtsEs} *(recess)*

F[]{#anchor-49}or you ro understand: if the word would “reces”, the
pronunciation would be {rEtsës}

[]{#anchor-50}**Frontdeck –** {frondEk} *(foredeck)*

F[]{#anchor-51}or you ro understand: if the word would “frontdec”, the
pronunciation would be {frOndëk}

**Taslime –** {taslIm} *(surrender)*

The first of two closed vowels, with exception of “i” and “u” as
semivowels.

**Armee – **{armEë} *(army)*

**Australia –** {aostrAlya} *(Australia)*

The final syllable: -in *(but not -ing)*, ey, ie, ui *(when the
pronunciation {wi})*, oCel *(where C is the only consonant)*.

**Hotel –** {hotEl} *(hotel)*

[]{#anchor-52}**Suadin – **{swadIn} *(fair weather)*

**Reling –** {rEling} *(railing)*

**Kierey –** {kyerEy} *(ram) *

The vowels “a”, “o” and “u” when before a consonant or semivowel, with
exception of a sole “s”.

**Cadaloc – **{kadalOk} *(anywhere)*

**Naval –** {navAl} *(naval)*

**Dayluk –** {daylUk} *(continent)*

### []{#anchor-53}NEVER IS ACCENTUATED

Prefixes.

[]{#anchor-54}***For*****trehc –** {fortrE:k} *(away; to depart for a
trip)*

*Re*cess

***Be*****vid** – {bëvId} *(to show, to prove)*

**For- –** prefix[]{#anchor-55} that means something far

**Re- –** prefix that means repetition

**Be- –** prefix that means something factive

The letter “w” when used as vowel.

**Sehkwnt –** {sE:kunt} *(*(they)* follow)*

A word finishing in -(i)um, -ule e -s.

[]{#anchor-56}**Schives –** {civz} *(to shift)*

[]{#anchor-57}**Territorium –** {territOryum} *(territory)*

**Insule –** {Insül} *(island)*

A alone vowel or semivowel at the end of a word.

**Okwi –** {Okwi} *(eyes)*

**Baby –** {bAbi} *(baby)*

The vowels “e”, “i” and “y” at the end of a word followed by a semivowel
– with the exception of “ey” – or two or diverse consonants, but not the
double ones.

[]{#anchor-58}**Seghel – **{sEgël} *(sail)*

**Tolkit –** {tOlkit} *(*(he/she/it)* talked)*

**Khitert –** {qItërt} *(evil *(noun)*)*

In compound words the stressed syllable stays the same of the original
word.

**Gouverne –** {gu:vErn} *(to govern)*

**Gouvernement –** {gu:vErnëmënt} *(government)*

**Nest –** {nest} *(nest)*

**Corcuksnest –** {korkUksnëst} *(crow's nest)*

These rules doesn't necessarily apply to proper nouns and the use of
hyphen preserves the accentuation in both sides.

IF YOU FOUND SOME SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT
---------------------------------------

I did my best to teach you each sound, but if you really can't learn
some of them – but I believe you can – it's not the end of the world!!!
If you can't pronounce the sounds /x/ e /ç/, no-one you put you in a
jail if you use /ʃ/ and /h/ in their places. If you can't pronounce the
japanese “r”, use our “r”. The good news is that the difficult sounds
are rarely used, with the exception of the vowels don't found in
english.

The advantage of learning the sambahsa's phonetics is that you master
the phonetics of many other languages.

SELLAMAT!
=========

Sellamat! It's with this word, “sellamat” {selamAt}, that we say
“hello”, you also may say “salut” {salUt}, which have the same function.

In this chapter I'll show you some sentences, maybe you'll deduce the
elements of each one by youself, but, anyway, in the posterior chapter
I'll unravel each sentence's element, so don't worry if you don't
understand something in this chapter.

Different from english and most of the auxiliary languages, the sambahsa
verbs are conjugated. All verbs are regular, with the exception of the
verbs “to be”, “to have” and “to know”, but they are not difficult.
Let's start with some basic sentences:

**Som **[]{#anchor-59}[]{#anchor-60}**John {som **[]{#anchor-61}**djOn}
–** []{#anchor-62}I am John

**Io som **[]{#anchor-63}**John {yo som djOn}***** *****–**
[]{#anchor-64}I am John

**Ego som **[]{#anchor-65}**John {Ego som djOn}***** *****–** I am John
*(more emphasis at “I”)*

Notice that, in the same way as occurs in the spanish language, in most
cases you may omit the pronoun, because of the own verb indicates the
used pronoun. You've just known the verb correspondent to “to be” when
linked to the pronoun “I”. Let's to the next sentences:

**Es **[]{#anchor-66}**Robert {es **[]{#anchor-67}**rObërt } –**
[]{#anchor-68}you are Robert

**Es **[]{#anchor-69}**Linda {es **[]{#anchor-70}**lInda} –**
[]{#anchor-71}you are Linda

**Is est Robert {is est rObërt} –** he are Robert

**Ia est Linda {ya est lInda} –** she are Linda

[]{#anchor-72}**Smos **[]{#anchor-73}**americans {smos
**[]{#anchor-74}**amerikAns} –** []{#anchor-75}we are americans

**Wey smos americans {wey smos amerikAns} –** we are americans

The next cases are fairly interesting:

**Id est gohd {id est go:d} –** it is good *(neutral)*

**El est gohd {el est go:d} –** he/she is good *(undetermined)*

**UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL:** neutral pronouns refers to things,
undetermined pronouns are used when doesn't know the genre or it's not
desired to say the genre. **Pay attention:** from now, all pronoun or
article that I *don't* indicate as *(neutral)* or *(undetermined)*, will
have the masculine genre or the feminine genre. Are we understood?

To make clear what is *neutral* and what is *undetermined*, look the
examples:

**Chair – **to the best of my knowledge, chairs don't have genre, so it
is *neutral*

**Dog –** if we don't know its genre, so it is *undetermined*

**Female dog –** feminine

**Grandfather –** masculine

**Tree –** even it is a living creature, it has not genre *(although you
can argue about dioecious plants)*, so it's *neutral*

**Daughter –** feminine

**Child –** as the genre is not specified, it's *undetermined*

**Android –** you decide, it depends of the context and point of view of
each one, it can be *neutral*, *undetermined* or even have a genre.

We've known the basic pronouns and their verbs, now let's see more
pronouns and verbs in the plural, let's use the word “prient” {pryent},
which means “friend”, and “gohd” {go:d}, which means “good”, in our
examples:

**Smos prients {smos pryents} –** []{#anchor-76}we are friends

**Wey smos prients {wey smos pryents} –** we are friends

**Ste prients {ste pryents} –** []{#anchor-77}you are friends

**Yu ste prients {yu ste pryents} –** you are friends

[]{#anchor-78}[]{#anchor-79}**Yu ste prient {yu ste pryent} –** you are
friend *(notice that this one is in the singular)*

**Tu es prient {tu es pryent} –** you are friend *(equal to the sentence
just above, but this is informal)*

**Ies sont prients {yes sont pryents} –**
[]{#anchor-80}[]{#anchor-81}they are friends *(all of masculine genre)*

**Ias sont prients {yas sont pryents} –**
[]{#anchor-82}[]{#anchor-83}they are friends *(all of feminine genre)*

**Ia sont gohd {ya sont go:d} –** they are goods *(neutral)*

**I sont prients {i sont pryents} –** they are friends *(undetermined)*

I believe I don't need to explain none of these sentences, I only have
to say that when “yu” is used in the singular, it is for formal
situation, with people you have no intimacy, therefore a courtesy
pronoun, and you use “tu” with close friends, family and kids.

Notice that, even in the singular, the pronoun “yu” make use of the verb
“ste”, because sambahsa works as in french or russian, the courtesy
pronoun, “yu”, is in the plural, even when in the singular. An example
from french: “Vous êtes un ami/des amis”; an example from russian:
“[]{#anchor-84}Вы остаётесь моим(и) другом/друзями” (you remain my
friend(s)).

Other important observation about the second person of plural “yu”. You
already know that is not necessary the use of the pronoun, but in future
examples you'll notice that the pronunciation of the third person of
singular and the second person of plural are very similar, look:

**Is lieubht me {is liÖb*****t***** me} –** he loves me

**Yu lieubhte me {yu liÖb*****t***** me} –** you love me

Did you imagine if didn't exist the pronoun? That's why the pronoun “yu”
almost have to appear.

It's important that you know how to say the verb “there be”, in the
sense of existence. It's is pretty similar to english, I'll use the noun
“anghen” {Angën}, which means “person”, and the adverb “her” {her},
which means “here”, in the following example:

**Sont anghens her {sont Angëns her} –** []{#anchor-85}there are persons
here

**Ter sont anghens her {ter sont Angëns her} –** there are persons here

Yes, you may use or not the “ter” if you want.

hol} –** I haven’t understood everything (what you wanted to say)

Good, at least you can start and finish a conversartion, continue
studying and you'll be able to maintain a conversation.

THE DECLINATION CASES
=====================

Sambahsa has a interesant caracteristic, it has a system of declination
cases which are: *nominative*, *accusative*, *dative* and *genitive*.
These cases refers to the pronouns and articles. But what they are and
how they are used?

Before let's remember those english classes of your school time, look
the sentence below:

**The man buys the car:** In this case “the man” is the *subject* of the
sentence, it's the subjetc because of is *doing* the action, which in
this case is the buying; and “the car” is the *direct object* of the
sentence, because of it's *suffering* the action, it's being affected
directly by the verb. Look the sentences below:

**I eat tomato –** “I” ([]{#anchor-92}subject), “tomato”
([]{#anchor-93}direct object)

**He loves Mary –** “he” (subject), “Mary” (direct object)

**People walk on the streets –** “people” (subject). Ops, this sentence
doesn't have a []{#anchor-94}direct object!

**They gave me a message:** we have one more element in this sentence,
it's the indirect object. We can easily recognize the subject, which is
“they”, but which one is the direct object and which one is the indirect
objetct? Remember, the direct object is that suffers the action, what is
being given, the person or the message? The message! The direct object
is “a message”. The indirect object is that is *beneficed* by the
action, which is being *indirectly* affected by the verb, which in this
case is “me”. Look the sentences below:

**I've sent you the documents –** “I” (subject), “you” (indirect
object), “documents” (direct object)

**She bought a dog for him –** “she”(subject), “dog” (direct object),
“him” (indirect object)

[]{#anchor-95}Now we can see the cases. I want to warning that I'll only
show you the cases for now, just for you recognize them by sight, I will
only show explanations in sentences after I explain the verbs, when
we'll be more comfortable to make sentences.

NOMINATIVE CASE
---------------

Basicaly it is the subject of a sentence.

**Ego / io {Ego / yo} –** I

**tu {tu} –** you

**Is {is} –** he

**Ia {ya} –** she

**Id {id} –** it *(neutral)*

**El {el} –** he / she / it []{#anchor-96}*(undetermined)*

**Wey {wey} –** we

**Yu {yu} –** yu

**Ies {yes} –** they []{#anchor-97}[]{#anchor-98}*(masculine)*

**Ias {yas}–** they []{#anchor-99}[]{#anchor-100}*(feminine)*

**Ia {ya} –** they *(neutral)*

**I {i} –** they []{#anchor-101}*(undetermined)*

PAY ATTENTION!!!!!!!! From the words below, just worry to initially
learn the underlined ones. The others you can learn over time, you don't
need be in a hurry!!!!!!

**So {so} –** this *(masculine)*

**Toy {toy} –** these *(masculine)*

**Sa {sa} –** this *(feminine)*

**Tas {tas} –** these *(feminine)*

**Tod {tod} –** this *(neutral)*

**Ta {ta} –** these *(neutral)*

**Tel {tel} –** this []{#anchor-102}*(undetermined)*

**Ti {Ti} –** these* *[]{#anchor-103}*(undetermined)*

**Cis {tsis} –** that []{#anchor-104}*(masculine)*

**Cies {tsyes} –** those []{#anchor-105}*(masculine)*

**Cia {tsya} –** that *(feminine)*

**Cias {tsyas} –** those []{#anchor-106}*(feminine)*

**Cid {tsid} –** that *(neutral)*

**Cia {tsya} –** those *(neutral)*

**Cel {tsel} –** that *(undetermined)*

**Ci {tsi} –** those *(undetermined)*

**Qui {ki} –** who *(masculine / singular)*

**Quis {kis} –** who *(masculine / singular / interrogative)*

**Quoy {kwoy} –** who *(masculine / plural)*

**Qua {kwa} –** who *(feminine / singular)*

**Quas {kwas} –** who []{#anchor-107}*(feminine / plural)*

**Quod {kwod} –** what *(neutral)*

**Qua –** what *(neutral)*

**Quel {kel} –** who []{#anchor-108}*(undetermined)*

**Qui {ki} –** who *(undetermined)*

**Neis {neys} –** none *(masculine / singular)*

**Noy {noy} –** none *(masculine / plural)*

**Nia {nya} –** none *(feminine / plural)*

**Nias {nyas} –** none *(feminine / plural)*

**Neid {neyd} –** []{#anchor-109}none, nothing *(neutral / singular)*

**Nia {nya} –** none, nothing *(neutral / plural*

**Nel {nel} –** none *(undetermined / singular)*

**Nei {ney} –** none* (undetermined / plural)*

**To {to} –** generic pronoun*, when the sense of approximation doesn't
apply, it can be translated as “this”, “that”, “these” and “those”*

The pronoun “ego” is the emphatized form of “io”. When we use “ego”
instead “io”, we want to say that there is a certain relevance in the
“I” is doing, or suffering, this or that action.

I'll ask you to stop here for a while and study the pronouns (only the
personal pronouns!), because of I will use them a lot from here.

About the other cases, it's enough read them once or twice at most, you
don't need record everything now! Follow the same method of study you
made with the nominative case, focus on the personal pronouns and in
those I indicate.

DECLINATIONS
============

PLURAL
------

**Nominative masculine –** -i

**Accusative masculine –** -ens

**Dative masculine –** -ims

[]{#anchor-140}**Genitive masculine –** -(e)n

**Nominative feminine –** -as

**Accusative feminine –** -ens

**Dative feminine –** -ims

**Genitive feminine –** -(e)n

**Nominative neutral –** -a

**Accusative neutral –** -a

[]{#anchor-141}**Dative neutral –** -ims

**Genitive neutral –** -(e)n

**Nominative undetermined –** -i

**Accusative undetermined –** -ens

**Dative undetermined –** -ims

**Genitive undetermined –** -(e)n

But, how the declinations are used? Sometimes their use is compulsory,
as in the words “vasyo” (everything) and “alyo” (another):

**Vasyas gwens –** all the women

**Alyo wir –** another man

**Vasyi paters –** all the fathers

**Alyo stul –** another chair

**Alya stuls –** another chairs

**Vasyo est correcto –** everything is correct

For euphonics effects or literary proposals, like poetry, you can use
these declinations in other words, for example the indefinite article
“un”, but often only apply these declinations to the words “vasyo” and
“alyo”. Remember however that those "euphonic" declensions can be used
only if they are compatible with the accentuation of the word

The sentence “un bell pwarn” {un bel pwarn}, which means “a pretty boy”,
may be written as “uno bello pwarn” {Uno bElo pwarn}.

The plural of “bell plaj” may be written as “bella plaja”.

Remember that, also, there is the genitive case, which represents
possession.

**Henrique's book –** Henriques buk

**Matheus' house –** Matheus*io*s dom *(notice that I've used the
complete termination because of “Matheus” already finishes with “s”)*

**Woman's son –** gwens son\
**America's beauty –** Americas beauteit

There is no mistery in the use of the declination in the accusative, you
only have to apply in the direct object. About the declination in the
genitive, I'll teach it after you learn the verbs, I think it's better
in this way.

**POSSESSION** 
===============

There the prepositions of possession:

**Masculine in the singular –** os

**Masculine in the plural –** om

**Feminine in the singular –** as

**Feminine in the plural –** am

**Neutral in the singular –** os

**Neutral in the plural –** om

[]{#anchor-142}**Undetermined in the singular –** es

**Undetermined in the plural –** em

Look an example:

**The death of Louis –** id mohrt os Louis {id mo:rt os lU:is}

When diverse elements are owners of something, it's interesting to use
the word “sbei”.

**The house of Paul and Peter –** Paul ed Peter sbei dom

“Ed” is the conjunction “and”, after I explain about conjunctions.

DIFFERENCE OF USE OF PREPOSITION OF POSSESSION AND GENITIVE CASE
----------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe you're a bit confuse and ask youself why the penultimate example
was not translated as “id mohrt *i*os Louis”. There is a simple
difference between a preposition of possession and a pronoun in the
genitive case.

**Ios –** of the

**Os –** of

**Ias –** of the

**As –** of

**Tos –** of that

Notice that, in the translations of the genitive case, we use the
definite article “the” with the preposition “of”, while the preposition
of possession is only translated to a preposition. I'll see you some
inappropriate sentences for you to understand:

“Id mohrt ios Louis” would be translated to “the death of the Louis” and
“Id apel os dru” would be translated to “the apple of tree”. Do you
understand now?

OTHER PREPOSITIONS OF POSSESSION
--------------------------------

**Mien {myen} –** my

**Tien {tyen} –** your *(singular)*

**Eys {eys} –** his

**Ays {ays} –** her

**Ids {Idz} –** its *(neutral)*

**Els {elz} –** his / her *(undeterminate)*

**Nies {nyes} –** our

**Noster {nOstër} –** our

**Vies {vyes} –** your []{#anchor-143}*(plural)*

**Voster {vOstër} –** your *(plural)*

**Ir {ir} –** their *(masculine, feminine, neutral and undeterminate)*

**Sien {syen} –** his, her, its, their. *Used when it refers to the subject of the sentence.*

**Uns {uns} –** of a(n)

**My house –** mien dom {myen dom}

**His city–** eys urb {eys urb}

**Our world –** nies mund {nyes mund} / noster mund {nOstër mund}

**Your land –** vies land {vyes land} / voster land {vOstër land}

“*Nies” and “noster”, as well as “vies” and “voster”, means the same
thing. *

I'll teach you how to use the pronoun “sien” after I teach you the
verbs”.

THE ARTICLES
============

DEFINITE ARTICLES
-----------------

A characteristic of sambahsa that stand out is its definite articles,
the words are the same of the pronouns. How? Look the translations
below:

**The man –** is wir {is wir}

**The woman –** ia gwen {ya gwen}

**The dog –** el kwaun {el kwAon}

**The person –** el anghen {el Angën} *or* el person {el përsOn}

**The person –** is anghen *(masculine person)*

**The country –** id land {id land}

**The people *****(from a determined culture)***** – **id folk {id folk}

**The people *****(low social class)***** –** id popule {id pOpül}

Can you understand how the language works? In the sambahsa logic you
don't speak “the secreatry” or “the man”, but “she secretary” and “he
man”. Have in mind that the articles suffers the declination as well as
the pronouns. For animals we don't use the article “id”, but the article
“el”, animals have gender too, they are not things!

***The***** dog loves *****the***** woman – ***el* kwaun lieubht *iam*
gwen {el kwAon liöbt yam gwen}

The same applies to an article as a indirect object, it is in the dative
case:

***The***** *****(female)***** manager sent *****the***** e-mail
*****for the***** *****(male)***** president –** *ia* manager yisit *id*
blixbrev *ei* president.

INDEFINITE ARTICLE
------------------

The indefinide article is “un”.

**A apple –** un apel {un Apël}

**A wall –** un mur {un mur}

**A girl –** un bent {un bent}

HOW TO SAY THE CONJUNCTIONS “AND” AND “OR”
========================================

I only want to teach already now this two very basic conjuctions,
because of, until we reach the chapter about conjuctions, maybe we will
have seen some examples with them.

The conjuction “and” is translated as “ed” for sambahsa.

**He and I – **is ed io

As “or” you need to pay a bit more of attention. When we deal with two
nouns or pronouns, we use “au”.

**He or me – **is au io {is Ao yo}

But when we deal with two sentences, we use the conjuction “we” (don't
confuse with the english pronoun!). I'll use a complex sentense, but
only look at how the conjuction is used:

[]{#anchor-144}My child, you must choose: to play in the park *or* to
swim in the pool

Mien purt, dehlcs chuses: likes in id park *we* snahe in id piscine

ADJECTIVES
==========

A adjective is a word that qualifies a noun, as in “the beautiful
house”, where the adjective “beautiful” qualifies the noun “house”. I
think I'll seize the moment to explain what is an adverb: an adverb
qualifies adjectives and verbs, like in “very fast”, where the adverb
“very” qualifies the adjective “fast”. Are we understood?

The construction of adjectives is similar to english, basically you have
to put the adjective just before the noun, but let's meet before some
adjectives and nouns we'll use in our examples:

**Veut {vöt} –** old

**Moll {mol} –** soft

**Pell {pel} –** fur

**Wogh {wog} –** car

**Bell {bel} –** beautiful

**Buland {bulAnd} –** tall

**Amin {amIn} –** reliable *(person)*

**Wassic {wAsik} –** reliable *(things)*

**Yun {yun} –** young

**Smulk {smulk} –** small

**Blou {blu:} –** blue

Eis os exemplos:

**Veut wogh –** old car

**Moll pel –** soft fur

Naturally you can make constructions like that:

**Id wogh est veut –** the car is old

Like in english, the adjectives don't receive the -s termination when in
the plural.

**Veut woghs –** old cars

**Moll pels –** soft furs

You may use the adjective alone and make it as a noun:

**The powerful *****woman***** –** []{#anchor-145}ia staur / ia staura

Notice that you need an article and you can make use of a declination,
when possible.

Also isn possible to make adjectives from verbs through participles, but
this I'l explain only in the chapter od participles.

To create adjectives from substantives you may make use of affixes like
-ic or -eus, like in the examples below:

**Bois sont cruor*****ic***** {boys sont krwOrik} –** battles are bloody

**Is est wirt*****ic***** {is est wIrtik} –** he is worthy

**Tod place est danger*****eus***** {tod plAts est dangërÖs} –** this
place is dangerous

**Ia gwen est nerv*****eus***** {ya gwen est nervÖs} –** the woman is
nervous

Don't worry very much about these affixes because many words can be used
as substantives or adjectives without the necessity of modifing the
word, like “infinitive”, which means “infinitive”*(what a big
surprise!)*, in“un infinitive verb”*(a infinitive verb)* or “smad studye
id infinitive”*(let's study the infinitive)*.

A *very important observation* is that the vocabulary of sambahsa comes
from languages of different families, like derivatives of latin and
germanic languages, the rules of making of adjectives from substantives
are adapted according to the origin of the word, sometimes you use other
affix, or other way, which is not through the -ic or -eus. See the
examples below:

[]{#anchor-178}**Es baygh bayasen –** you're very fearful **{correct
Ѵ}**

Sometimes may be not interessant to use a affix for using a substantive
as adjective, but a preposition like “os” or "es" may be a good alternative.

[]{#anchor-179}**Kamo anon es kwaun –** []{#anchor-180}I like food of
dog

**Lieubho likes RPGs os table –** []{#anchor-181}I love playing tabletop RPGs

Wouldn't make sense to say something like []{#anchor-182}“…kwaunic anon”
or []{#anchor-183}“… []{#anchor-184}tableus RPG”, because “…kwaunic
anon” gives the impression of the food has some canine characteristic,
although the food is for dogs, and “… []{#anchor-185}tableus RPG” gives
the impression that the RPG have a characteristic of table, although the
game normally is played on the table.

The most interessant way of expressing the ideas of the two last
examples is:

**Kamo kwaun-anon –** I like dog food

**Lieubho likes table-RPGs –** I love playing tabletop RPGs

Notice that the “table” of “table-RPG” and the “kwaun” of “kwaun-anon”
are not as adjectives, but as components of a word made throught the
aglutination of other words. If, for example, the “table” of “table-RPG”
were an adjetive, would be possible the sentense “id RPG est table”,
what doesn't make the minor sense. Ah, and you could write “kwaun-anon”
and “table-RPG” without the hyphens, leaving them thus: “kwaun anon” and
“table RPG”.

Know also the []{#anchor-186}[]{#anchor-187}[]{#anchor-188}predicative
adjective over the object, very used in sentenses like the ones of the
below examples:

[]{#anchor-189}**Ho pict mien dom do glend –** I've painted the house
green

**Ia me hat kalen zani –** she has called me adulterous

**Tod anon kwehrt/beuwt me sieug –** this food makes me sick

I'll use the first example, “[]{#anchor-190}ho pict mien dom do glend”,
to explain more about this kind of situation. We couldn't have written
“[]{#anchor-191}ho pict mien dom glend” because thus the “glend” would
be in the accusative and the translation would be something like “I've
painted my green of house”, it wouldn't make sense, and remember that
the sambahsa adjectives come before the substantive. Also we couldn't
write “[]{#anchor-192}ho pict mien glend dom”, because the translation
is “I've painted my green house”, which, although is gramatically
perfect, definitivaly shows the wrong idea.

I think it's pertinent to make some observations about these last
examples, they are very interesting.

Notice that , for building the []{#anchor-193}predicative adjective over
the object in the first example, it was made use of the preposition
“do”, which you'll learn with more details in future chapters, but you
can rewrite these sentenses in other way, like for example: “Ho pict(o)
glend(o) mien dom”, thus the “glend” is not taken to be the attributive
adjective of “dom”.

In the second example I could make the word “zani” a substantive if I
add a indefinite article before this word: “Ia me hat kalen *un* zani”;
the meaning pratically still is the same. But this case is no more a
[]{#anchor-194}predicative adjective over the object, but a *nominal*
adjective over the object.

There is a way of write better the third sentence, it would be making
use of the suffix -eih, which is a factive, you'll learn about affixes
in a specific chapter. The sentense would be thus: “Tod anon sieugeiht
me” *(this food sickens me)*. I didn't use it in the examples because
thus the sentence no more would be a predicative adjective over the
object.

COMPARISONS
-----------

The comparison is made suffixing the -er to adjective (or -ter in the
case the word finishes with a voewl), but only use this termination when
the accentuation of the word is not altered, in other case use the word
“meis”, which means “more”; “quem” means “than”.

**He is older than me –** is est veuter quem io {is est vÖtër kem yo}

**He is taller than me –** is est meis buland quem io {is est meys
bulAnd kem yo}

Comparisons of equality are made with tem … quem, which may be
translated as as … as.

**Mary is as beautiful as Elizabeth – **Maria est tem bell quem
Elizabeth

Comparison od inferiority as made with minter … quem, which may be
translated to less … than.

**Wolves are less reliable than dogs –** wolfs sont minter amin quem
kwauns {wolfs sont mIntër amIn kem kwAons}

A important observation is about the adjective “amin” is that actually
it is for humans, but the other sambahsa adjective for reliable, which
is “wassic”, is for things. Which one use? You choose, I prefered
“amin”, but wouldn't be wrong to use “wassic”, it depends of the
person's world perspective.

“Meis” and “minter” (sometimes "mins" instead of "minter", but rare) are comparative words, now let's talk about
superlatives. But what are superlatives? Look the two examples below:

[]{#anchor-195}Charles is taller than Michael

Steven is the tallest

Charles is taller than Michael, but it doesn't mean that necessarily
doesn't exist people taller than Charles, the “taller” is a comparative,
it only makes the comparison between two beings. But the second sentence
says that Steven is taller than everyvody in the context where he is,
“tallest” is a superlative. Of course the same thought applies to
comparisons of inferiority:

Charles is less tall than Michael

Steven is the less tall

The superlatives are “meist”, which means “most”, and “minst”, which
means “less”. Look the examples below:

[]{#anchor-196}**Matthew is the tallest –** Matthew est is meist buland

**Matthew is the less tall –** Matthew est is minst buland

**I am the most young in my house –** som is yunst in mien dom

**Sharon is the most reliable woman –** Sharon est ia aminst gwen

The adjectives “megil” {mEdjil} *(large)* and “lytil” {lÜtil} *(little)*
are the only ones that have irregular comparative and superlative forms,
they are:

**Comparative:** “meger” {mEdjër} and “lyter” {lÜtër}

**Superlative:** “megst” {megst} and “lytst” {lütst}

PLURAL
======

The plural is easy and intuitive, often the words at plural ends with a
-s added at the final of the words, as made in english, this is
basically the standard form.

**Prince {prints} *****(prince)***** –** princes {prIntsës} *(princes)*

**Div {div}***** (god)***** –** divs {divs} *(gods)*

**Kwaun {kwaun} *****(dog)***** –** kwauns {kwAons} *(gods)*

**Land {land} *****(country)***** –** lands {landz} *(countries)*

Word finished with -um have its final replaced by -a.

**Territorium {te(r)ritOryum} *****(territory)***** –** territoria
{te(r)ritOrya} *(territories)*

**Collegium {kolEdjyum} *****(college)***** –** collegia {kol(l)Edjya}
*(colleges)*

For words finished with -es or -os, , it's replaced these terminations
respectively for -si e -sa.

**Daumos {dAwmos} *****(marvel)***** –** daumsa {dAwmsa} *(marvels)*

**Elkos {Elkos} *****(ulcer)***** –** elksa (Elksa) *(ulcers)*

**Bes {bes} *****(boss) *****–** besi {bEzi} *(bosses)*

**Kames {kams} *****(spell)***** –** kamsa {kamsa} *(spells)*

There will situations that it's not possible to add a -s at the end of
the word for pronunciation issues, in these cases it's added the
terminations -i *(*[]{#anchor-197}*animated beings)* or -a *(unanimated
beings)*.

**Magv {magv} *****(child)***** – **magvi {mAgvi} *(children)*

**Kwax {kwaks} *****(croack)***** –** kwaxa {kwAksa} *(croacks)*

**Urx {urks} *****(bear)***** –** urxi {Urksi} *(bears)*

**Rawaj {rawAj} *****(currency unit)***** –** rawaja {rawAja} *(currency
units)*

**Aux {Aoks} *****(ox)***** –** auxi {Aoksi} *(oxen)*

**Kwas {kwas} *****(cough)***** –** kwasa {kwAza} *(cough)*

**Musch {muc} *****(fly)***** –** muschi {mUci} *(flies)*

*The only exception is “ok” (eye), whose plural can be “oks” {oks} or
“okwi” {okwi}.*

Some examples with articles:

**The men –** ies wirs {yes wirs}

**The women –** ias gwens {yas gwens}

**The cars –** ia woghs {ya wogz}

**The persons –** i anghens {i Angëns}

**The dogs –** i kwauns {i kwAons}

**The people –** i leuds {i lödz}

For finishing, an example of plural with declination:

**Plur millions brasileiren –** several millions of brazilians

Notice that was written “brasileiren” instead “brasileirs”, but I could
would use anyone without problems, but if you use “brasilers”, don't
forget to use the “em”, that would be “Plur millions em brasileirs
vahnt…”

DO YOU IS A BIT CONFUSE WITH SO MANY “MUCHS” AND “FEWS”?
--------------------------------------------------------

You must observe what is adjective, what is adverb and what is both,
this is very important! Let's see the implications of that:

“Baygh” may not be used before an adjective followed by a substantive, a
sentence like “baygh smulk magvi” would mean what? “many small children”
or “very small children”? Remember that “baygh” can serve as adjective
as adverb, so there is the doubt of what word it qualifies. In such
cases the ideal is to use a more specific word, one that is only an
adjective or only an adverb. *“Baygh” exists to avoid the repetition of
“maung” in a text*.

Look: “maung belli leuds” {mAong bEli lödz}, I know that this sentence
means “many beautiful persons”, but *not* “very beautiful persons”,
because of “maung” only serves as adjective.

I believe you already understand it. Some good examples for you to fix
it in your mind:

***Maung***** smulk magvi –** []{#anchor-203}many small children

***Meg***** smulk magvi –** []{#anchor-204}very small children

**Tod land hat *****pauk***** bella plaja –** []{#anchor-205}this
country has few beautiful beachs

**Tod land hat *****pau***** bella plaja –** this country has not-very
beautiful beachs. 

You have surely that some of the above-mentionned words work sometimes
as an adjective, and sometimes as an adverb. What makes the difference ?
It is an adjective when it refers to the quantity of the substantive, 
but an adverb when it refers to the quality of the adjective. 

**Volo lyt cofie -** I want a little of coffee

**Lyt-ye bitter cofie -** Slightly bitter coffee

To make the difference, when there is a risk of confusion, use the
hyphenated ending "-ye" for adverbs, and, if possible, the "euphonic"
declensional endings for adjectives. 


About “destull”:

What differentiates “destull” of words like “meg” ou “baygh” is that
“destull” is in an inferior level, see the examples below for you to
understand:

**Brasilu est meg/baygh bell –** Brazil is very beautiful *(in the
superior category of beauty)*

**Brasilu est destull bell –** Brazil is quite beautiful *(it is
beautiful, but there are other countries that are more beautiful)*

NUMBERS
=======

There the numbers form 0 to 10:

**0 – zero {dzEro} –** zero

**1 – oin {oyn} –** one

**2 – dwo {dwo} –** two

**3 – tri {tri} –** three

**4 – quar {kwar} –** four

**5 – penk(we) {penk(wë)} –** five

**6 – six {siks} –** six

**7 – sept(a) {sEpt(a)} –** seven

**8 – oct(o) {Okt(o)} –** eight

**9 – nev {nev} –** nine

**10 – dec {dek} –** ten

Between 11 and 19 you add the suffix -dem.

**11 – oindem {Oyndëm} –** eleven

**12 – dwodem {dwOdëm} –** twelve

**13 – tridem {trIdëm} –** thirteen

**14 – quardem {kwArdëm} –** fourteen

**15 – penkdem {pEnkdëm} –** fifteen

**16 – sixdem {sIksdëm} –** sixteen

**17 – septdem {sEptdëm} –** seventeen

**18 – octdem {Oktdëm} –** eighteen

**19 – nevdem {nEvdëm} –** nineteen

For numbers like 20, 30, 40, …, 90 you use the suffix -gim

**20 – dwogim {dwOdjim} –** twenty

**30 – trigim {trIdjim} – **thirty

**40 – quargim {kwArdjim} – **forty

**50 – penkgim {pEnkdjim} –** fifty

**60 – sixgim {sIksdjim} –** sixty

**70 – septgim {sEptdjim} –** seventy

**80 – octgim {Oktdjim} –** eighty

**90 – nevgim {nEvdjim} –** ninety

There the numbers 100, 1000, 1000000 and 1000000000:

**100 – cent(om) {tsent / tsëntOm} –** one hundred

**1,000 – mil {mil} –** one thousand

**1,000,000 – oin million {oyn milyOn} –** one million

**1,000,000,000 – oin milliard {oyn milyArd} –** one billion

Some examples of numbers:

**23 – dwogim tri –** twenty three

**130 – cent trigim –** one hundred and thirty

**569 – penkcent sixgim nev –** f[]{#anchor-206}ive hundred and
sixty-nine

**1992 – mil nevcent nevgim dwo –** []{#anchor-207}one thousand nine
hundred ninety-two

Cardinal numbers are made with the suffix -t (or -im if the first suffix
for incompatible).

**First –** ~~oint~~ prest *(if it's the first of a group of two, we use
“preter” instead “prest”)*

**Second –** dwot *(or “second”)*

**Third – **trit

**Fourth–** quart

**Fifth –** penkt

**Sixth –** sixt

**Seventh –** septim

**Eighth –** octim

**Ninth –** nevt

**Tenth –** dect

Yes, “first” and “second” are irregular, despite be admitted the “dwot”.

Only the last component needs termination:

**Twenty first –** dwogim prest

Know these too:

**Last –** senst *(superlative)*

**Latter –** senter *(comparative)*

A multiplicator is made with the suffix -(en)s:

**Once –** oins

**Twice –** dwis *(irregular)*

[]{#anchor-208}**Thrice –** tris

We also may use the word “ker”:

**Once –** oin kers

**Twice –** dwo kers

**Thrice –** tri kers

The distributive is made with the suffix -(e)n, but there are irregular
forms:

**1 –** ein

**2 –** dwin *(“duo”) *(for the word “pair” exists the word “pair”,
yeah, it's the same word)

**12 – **douzen *(our “dozen”!)*

**1000 –** tusent

For numbers finished in -dem or -gim, you use -tia instead -(e)n.

**20 –** []{#anchor-209}dwogimtia *(like a score)*

This termination -(e)n also is used for counting nouns that doesn't have
a form in the singular:

**Mi ho kaupen trin bruks –** I’ve bought myself three pairs of pants

If the distributive is used as quantity, then the nouns and adjectives
are in the plural of genitive.

**Un centen wolfen gwiviet in France –** a[]{#anchor-210} hundred wolves
could live in France

Remember of “million” and “milliard”? They only exist in the
distributive form. But when the distributive is followed by another
number, the distributive doesn't more need be in the infinitive.

**1891400 humans –** Oino million octcent nevgim oino mil quarcent
mensci

Parts can be indicated by -del.

**One third –** tridel

But look:

**Half *****(as substantive) *****–** []{#anchor-211}dwidel

**Half *****(as adjective)***** –** pwol *(often used as prefix)*

**Pwolter –** 1,5

The other 0,5 is taken using the ordinal form of the next number after
the “pwol”. Look one more example:

**Pwolpenkt – **4,5

TIME
====

To indicate the day of a month, we put the “dien” vefore the cardinal
number of the date,

[]{#anchor-212}Dien quar jul mil septcent septgim six, ia Uniet Stats
bihr independent

On the fourth of July of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six,
United States became independent

Dien sept september mil octcent dwogim dwo, Brasilu bihsit independent

On the seventh of september of one thousand eight hundred and
eighty-two, Brazil became independent

**September {sëptEmbër} –** September

**October {oktObër} –** October

**November {novEmbër} –** November

**December {dëtsEmbër} –** December

To indicate the hours, the best way is putting the number's hour before
of “saat” {saAt} following the minute's numbers.

**18:49 –** octdem saat quargim nev

To indicate a determined decade, like “the 70's”, you inform the year
more the termination -tias.

**Ia 1970 –** **Ia mil nevcent septgimtias –** the (19)70's

A adverb of period of time may be made per the termination -s.

**I beis, qui wey eiskwmos, appareihnt noct*****s***** –** the bees,
which we want, appears at night

The present period of time may be indicated by the prefix ho-:

**Tonight – **honoct

**This evening –** hovesper

But “today” and “this morning” are made in the following ways:

**Today –** hoyd

**This morning –** Todeghern

A verb that indicates a period of time spent can be made per the prefix
(u)per-.

**Passe ad upernocte in mien dom – **spend the night in my house

**Uperdienam in id farm –** we spent the day in the farm

There the translations for “tomorrow, “yesterday and their variations:

**Tomorrow –** cras

**Yesterday – **ghes

**After tomorrow –** poscras

**Of yesterday –** ghestern

**Before yesterday –** []{#anchor-217}preghes {prëgEs}

More important words:

**Hourly –** []{#anchor-218}horlong

**Last week –** []{#anchor-219}perhvdi {pEr(h)vdi}

**Every time –** []{#anchor-220}stets (used in general with comparatives)

**In times past –** []{#anchor-221}xiawngja {ksyAwngja}

**Last night –** yarlay {yarlAy}

**Day & night *****(24 horas)***** –** yawm {yAwm}

CORRELATIVES

pronouns or other words, like “anghen” *(person)*, “ject” *(thing)* and
“loc” *(place)*.

> about the shoe to b worn in his foot

> **Quodkwe schou est util pro me:** it’s more serious

dex(ter), naturally that are possible forms like levtro/dextro and
levtos/dextos.

“Outside” and “inside” are represented respectively for “exo” and “eni”
*(irregular words)*, are possible forms like extro/extos and
entro/entos.

An adverb of direction can be made per the suffix -worts, like in “Vasya
fluvs sreunt marworts” {vAsya fluvz srönt marwOrtz} (“all rivers flow to

**Solg, talg {solg, talg} –** Such

**Quod? {kwod} –** What?[]{#anchor-223}

**Semject, semquod {semjEkt, semkwOd} –** something

**Quant(o/um) {kwAnt(o/um)} –** everything

**Khich {qitc} –** nothing at all

Quant- may serve as relative pronoun, you only have to add the
declination terminations to it.

**Quan(do) {kwAn(do)}? –** when?

**Kun {kun} –** when, as

**Kun gnahsim, mien scol dar ne existit –** when I born, my school still

**Tun {tun} –** then

**Semper {sEmpër} –** always

**Naiw(o) {nÄw(o)} –** never

**Nuntos {nUntos} –** from now on

**Tuntos {tUntos} –** for this time/epoch

**Hol {hol} –** whole, integer *(adjective)*

**Alnos {Alnos} –** completely, wholly *(adverb)*

**Ceter {tsEtër} –** all the other

**Ielg {yelg} –** each *(for more than two)*

**Ieter {yEtër} –** either, each *(for a group of two)*

**Cada {kAda} –** each, every

THE VERBS
=========

Ah, the verbs…

With the exception of three verbs, “ses” {ses}, “habe” {hab} and “woide”
{woyd}, all the other verbs are regular, you only need pay attention to
some cases, predicted by the ortographic rules.

It's common, in other languages, the verbs be represented in their
infinitive form, like in dictionaries for example, but in sambahsa the
standard form of presentation is in the form of *stem*. I want that is
be very clear from now, the translations of the sambahsa verbs will be
provided in the infinitive form, even when the verbs are in their
original form (only the stem). For example: the word “sedd”, as a verb,
I translate as “to sit” (infinitive of english), but “to sit” in the
infinitive of sambahsa is “sedde”, not “sedd”. Don't worry that I'll
warn you when the verb be in the infinitive, I only want that you know
that when I show you something like “linekw = to leave”, don't think that
“linekw” already is the verb in the infinitive. Are we understood?

Let's meet the irregular verbs:

**Es {es} –** to be

**Hab {hab} –** to have

**Woid {woyd} –** to know

[]{#anchor-224}“Es”, “hab” and “woid” are verbs in the stem form, the
infinitive form of them is respectively “ses”, “habe” and “woide”. You
don't need to worry a lot about “es”, “hab” and “woid” since these verbs
are irregular.

PRESENT
-------

You already know the conjugation of the verb “es” in the present, but
costs nothing repeat them:

**Som {som} –** *(I)* am

**Es {es} –** *(you)* are *(singular)*

**Est {est} –** *(he/she/it)* is

**Smos {smos} –** *(we)* are

**Ste {ste} –** *(you)* are *(plural)*

**Sont {sont} –** *(they)* are

The verb “ste” is pronounced {ste} because {st} is not a viable
pronounce.

The pronouns were omitted, but you are entirely free to use them too.
Look the very same conjugation from above, but with the pronouns:

**Io som {yo som} –** I am

**Tu es {tu es} –** you are

**Is/Ia/Id/El est {is/ya/id/el est} –** he/she/it is

**Wey smos {wey smos} –** we are

**Yu Ste {yu ste} –** you are

**Ies/Ias/Ia/I sont {yes/yas/ya/i sont} –** they are

From now I'll omit the pronouns in the conjugations, but know you may
use them.

Now let's see the conjugations of the verbs “hab” and “woid”:

**Ho {ho} –** *(I)* have

**Has {has} –** *(you)* have *(singular)*

**Hat {hat} –** *(he/she/it)* has

**Habmos / Hams {hAbmos / hams} –** *(we)* have

**Yu habte {yu habd} –** *(you)* have *(plural)*

**Habent / Hant {hAbënt / hant} –** *(they)* have

**Woidim {wOydim} –** *(I)* know

**Woidst(a) {wOydst(a)} –** *(you)* know *(singular)*

**Woidit {wOydit} –** *(he/she/it)* knows

**Woidam {woydAm} –** *(we)* know

**Woidat {woydAt} –** *(you)* know *(plural)*

**Woideer {woydEër} –** *(they)* know

The conjugation of woid is not compulsory.

The conjugation of the verbs in the present is made with the following
terminations:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-225}**person singular:** -m *(when after
the sound of vowel or {y})*, -o *(in other cases)*. If the stem of the verb ends
with "-e" or if the addition of "-o" would be incompatible with the
accentuation, add nothing  but use the personal pronoun "io". 

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -s

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -t

**1**^**st**^** person plural:** -m(o)s (use the one compatible with the
accentuation)

**2**^**nd**^** person plural:** -t(e) (use "-t" if "-te" is incompatible with 
the accentuation)

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -(e)nt, -e (use the one compatible with the
accentuation)

Let's more one example:

**I love you –** te lieubho {te lyÖbo}

**You love me –** []{#anchor-226}me lieubhs {me lyÖbs}

**She loves him –** ia lieubht iom {ya lyÖbt yom}

**The dog loves the woman –** el kwaun lieubht iam gwen {el kwAon lyöbt
yam gwen}

**We love them *****(in this case “them” refers to female persons)*****
–** lieubhmos ians {lyÖbmos yans}

**You love us *****(“you” is in the plural)***** –** yu lieubhte nos {yu
lyÖbt nos}

**They love me –** ies lieubhent me {yes lyÖbënt me}

As oftern the pronouns are easily identified (if they are nominative,
accusative, etc) you are free to change the order of them in the
sentence, but maintain the good sense for avoiding misunderstandings.
You may say too:
[]{#anchor-227}[]{#anchor-228}[]{#anchor-229}[]{#anchor-230}lieubho te,
lieubhs me, []{#anchor-231}io []{#anchor-232}lieubho te, tu lieubhs me,
te []{#anchor-233}lieubho io, me lieubhs tu.

More an example to you understand it well:

***(I)***** learn sambahsa –** euco sambahsa {Öko sambA:sa}

***(You)***** learn sambahsa –** eucs sambahsa {öks sambA:sa}

***(He/she/it)***** learns sambahsa –** euct sambahsa {ökt sambA:sa}

***(We)***** learn sambahsa –** eucmos sambahsa {Ökmos sambA:sa}

***(You)***** learn sambahsa –** yu eucte sambahsa {yu ökt sambA:sa}

***(They)***** learn sambahsa –** eucent sambahsa {Ötsënt sambA:sa}

BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE NASAL INFIX
---------------------------------------

I will talk about the nasal infix with more details in an appropriate
chapter, but as I need right now that you have a notion about this
subject, here a quick explanation.

A verb with nasal infix is that one which have an *un*stressed “e”
between consonants, which *must* be “m” or “n”. In all the other verbal
tenses, with the exception of a form of imperative that uses the own
stem form of the verb, this kind of verb will suffer aa alteration,
which basically is a lost of the unstressed “e” and, maybe, some other
modifications that I will explain in the appropriate chapter.

Look how it works:

**Linekw –** linkw

**Pregen –** pregn

PAST TENSE
----------

There are two verbal tenses in the past for the verb “es”, the simple
past and the imperfect, while the first one informs about a punctual
time in the past, the second one deals with situations that happened
continuously in the past and ended.

Simple past

**Buim {bwim} –** []{#anchor-234}*(I)* was

**Buist(a) {bwIst(a)} –** []{#anchor-235}*(you)* were

**Buit {bwit} –** []{#anchor-236}*(he/she/it)* was

**Buam {bwam} –** []{#anchor-237}*(we)* were

**Buat {bwat} –** []{#anchor-238}*(you)* were

**Buir {bwir} –** []{#anchor-239}*(they)* were

Imperfect past

**Eem {Eëm} –** *(I)* was

**Ees {Eës} –** *(you)* were

**Eet {Eët} –** *(he/she/it)* was

**Eemos {Eëmos} –** *(we)* were

**Yu eete {yu Eët} –** *(you)* were

**Eent {Eënt} –** *(they)* were

Try see these verbs from “imperfect past” like “I used to be”, “you used
to be”, “she was being”, “we were being”.

As the verb “hab” as the verb “woid” only have the simple past.

**Hiebim {hyEbim} –** *(I)* had

**Hiebst(a) {hyEbst} –** *(you)* had

**Hiebit {hyEbit} –** *(he/she/it)* had

**Hiebam {hyebAm} –** *(we)* had

**Hiebat {hyebAt} –** *(you)* had

**Hiebeer {hyebEër} –** *(they)* had

**Woisim {wOyzim} –** *(I)* knew

**Woisist {wOyzist} –** *(you)* knew

**Woisit {wOyzit} –** *(je/she/it)* knew

**Woisam {woyzAm} –** *(we)* knew

**Woisat {woyzAt} – ***(you)* knew

**Woiseer {woyzEër} –** *(they)* knew

The conjugation of the verb “wois” is not compulsory.

The conjugation of the verbs in the past is made per the following
terminations:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-240}**person singular:** -im

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -(i)st(a) (use what is 
compatible with the accentuation)

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -it

**1**^**st**^** person plural:** -am

**2**^**nd**^** person plural:** -at

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -eer *(it's -r when the verb finishes
with a accentued vowel)*

Between the stem of the verb and the termination of the conjugation may
be interessant the use of the -s-, when the stem finishes with the sound
of vowel, but it's not mandatory! Look an example below:

[]{#anchor-241}**ghyah {gya:} –** to gape

**ghyah + s + it = ghyahsit {gyA:sit} –** (he/she/it) gaped

An example to you understand:

[]{#anchor-242}***(***[]{#anchor-243}***I)***** browed –** brovim
{brOvim}

***(You)***** browed – **brovist {brOvist} *or* brovsta {brOvzta}

***(He/she/it)***** browed –** brovit {brOvit}

***(We)***** browed –** brovam {brovAm}

***(You)***** browed – **brovat {brovAt}

***(They)***** browed –** broveer {brovEër}

“Brovista” is not possible because of the “a” would change the
accentuation of the word.

Apropos, “brov” also means the substantive “eyebrow”.

**Attention:** the conjugation of the verbs in the past, whose stems are
altered, is *not* compulsory!

I know that is kinda ridiculous repeat it, but it's in the case still
exists doubts. You may say “io buim”, “wey brovam”, “tu ees”, etc, using
the pronouns. It's the last time I notify you this possibility, my
conjugations are made without the pronouns, but it doesn't mean that
they may not be usen! I say the same for any verbal tense.

### ACTUALLY THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF REPRESENTING THE PAST

What you just saw is the simple past, which the actions started and
ended in the past and ***didn't** let consequences in the present*. The
other form is the perfect present, which the actions still occurs in the
present or, although the actions finished in the past, *they left some
consequence in the present*; the present perfect is made through the
verb “habe” + the participle in passive past (as I'll only teach you the
participles in future chapters, I'll limit me to show you examples here,
you don't need to know how to made them now, but I know that you at
least know how to identify them).

Observe the examples below to you understand the differences (notice
that the (a)s are in the simple past while the (b)s are in the present
perfect):

**(1a) Is gwivit in Rome unte oct yars –** he lived in Rome for eight
years

**(1b) Is hat gwiwt in Rome unte oct yars –** he has lived in Rome for
wight years

**(2a) Ia ghiet iom **[]{#anchor-244}**gouverneur –** []{#anchor-245}she
met the governor\
**(2b) Ia hat ghaten iom gouverneur –** she has met the governor

**(3a) Lusim mien cleich –** I lost my key

**(3b) Ho lusen mien cleich –** []{#anchor-246}I've lost my key

In (1a) the person lived in Rome in the past, but currently he lives in
other place or he is no more alive; in (1b) he has lived in Rome and
still is there. In (2a) kinda implies the governor don't have his
position nowadays; in (2b) we know the governor still is alive and still
has his position. In (3a) I lost my keys in the past, but I already have
found them or it is no more important currently; in (3b) I've lost my
keys, I didn't find them and I suffer the consequences like don't be
able to enter into my own house.

INFINITIVE
----------

You were expecting that I would talk about the future tense, weren't? I
will talk about the future tense in other opportunity because of I will
need the infinitive to explain it.

**Ses {ses} –** to be

**Habe {hab} –** to have

**Woide {woyd} –** to know

Verbs finished in an unstressed “e” don't change:

**Accepte {ak(t)sEpt(ë)} –** Accepte *(accepet)*

For verbs with the nasal infix, the unstressed “e” is removed and is
added the termination -es.

For verbs with “ei”{ey} or “eu”{ö} have these parts replaced
respectively for “i” and “u” and is added the termination -es.

**Linekw {lInëkw}** – linkwes {lInkwës} *(to leave)*

**Dreiv {dreyv} –** drives {drivz} *(to drift)*

[]{#anchor-247}**Ghieul {giÖl} –** ghiules {gyüls} *(to carbonize)*

In all the other cases it's enough to add the final -e when it doesn't
change the accentuation, if the accentuation is altered the word simply
remains unaltered.

[]{#anchor-248}**Garabat {garabAt} –** garabate {garabAt} *(to
scribble)*

**Hinder {hIndër} – **hinder {hIndër} *(to hinder)*

Let's see a practical example:

**Tehrbo kaupe anon {tE:rbo kAop anOn} –** I have to buy food

**Tehrb {te:rb} –** have to

***Kaup {kAop} –** buy*

### THE USE OF THE PREPOSITION “AD” WITH VERBS IN THE INFINITIVE

You've meet an example of the kind:

**Ghohdim kaupe un wogh {gO:dim kAop un wog} –** I could buy a car

**Pitim nices un wir {pItim nItsës un wir} –** I tried to kill a man

But verbs that denotes movement you must use the preposition “ad”, which
you will know with more details in a future chapter. That happens
because sambahsa infinitives behave like substantives, except that they
don't use any article.

**Ia ihsit *****ad***** vide sien son {ya I:sit ad vid syen son} –** she
went []{#anchor-249}to see her son

A situation where the verb is explicitly used as substantive:

**Is hehlpt iom *****ad***** tarjmes id dictionar do portughesche {is
he:lpt yom ad tArjmës id diktyonAr do portugEc} –** he helps him to
translate the dictionary to portuguese

Othe similar situation, but with two verbs in the infinitive:

**(Tu) has gwiven kay hehlpe *****ad***** cree un nov mund {(tu) has
gwIvën kay he:lp ad crEë un nov mund} –** you have lived to help create a
new world

FUTURE
------

The conjugations of the three main verbs:

**Sessiem {sesyEm} –** []{#anchor-250}*(I)* will be

**Sessies {sesyEs} –** *(you)* will be

**Sessiet {sesyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* will be

**Sessiemos {sesyEmos} –** *(we)* will be

**Yu sessiete {yu sesyEt} –** *(you)* will be

**Sessient {sesyEnt} –** *(they)* will be

**Habsiem {habsyEm} –** []{#anchor-251}*(I)* will have

**Habsies {habsyEs} –** *(you)* will have

**Habsiet {habsyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* will have

**Habsiem(o)s {habsyEm(o)s} –** *(we)* will have

**Yu habsiete {yu habsyEt} –** *(you)* will have

**Habsient {habsyEnt} –** *(they)* will have

**Woidsiem {woydsyEm} –** []{#anchor-252}*(I)* will know

**Woidsies {woydsyEs} –** *(you* will know

**Woidsiet {woydsyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* will know

**Woidsiem(o)s {woydsyEm(o)s} –** *(we)* will know

**Yu woidsiete {yu woydsyEt} –** *(you)* will know

**Woidsient {woydsyEnt} –** *(they)* will know

The conjugation of the verbs in the future is made in two forms:

In the first one you use the verbal form in the 2^nd^ person singular
plus the particle “ie” and the conjugations of present, look an example
below:

**You permit –** permitts {permItz} *(2*^*nd*^* person singular in the
present)*

[]{#anchor-253}[]{#anchor-254}***(I)***** will permit – **permittsiem
{përmitsyEm}

***(You)***** will permit –** permittsies {permitsyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** will permit –** permittsiet {permitsyEt}

***(We)***** will permit –** permittsiem(o)s {permitsyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** will permit –** yu permittsiete {yu permitsyEt}

***(They)***** will permit –** permittsient {permitsyEnt}

In the second form you use the auxiliar sie- (conjugated!) plus the verb
in the infinitive, look the same example from above conjugated in this
way:

[]{#anchor-255}***(I)***** will permit –** siem permitte {syem permIt}

***(You)***** will permit –** sies permitte {syes permIt}

***(He/she/it)***** will permit –** siet permitte{syet permIt}

***(We)***** will permit –** siem(o)s permitte {syEm(o)s permIt}

***(You)***** will permit –** yu siete permitte {yu syet permIt}

***(They)***** will permit –** sient permitte {syent permIt}

It's a kinda similar to english.

Sambahsa has the negative version of sie-, which works in the same way
(i.e. only as an independent particle, but never as a suffix),
it's the nie-.

***(I)***** wont permit –** niem permitte {nyem permIt}

### THE NEAR FUTURE

For an event that is close to occur, we use the auxiliar “vah…”. It
works in the following way, we add to this auxiliary the appropriate
conjugation and then we put the verb in the infinitive. I am going to
use the verb “orbat” (to work) in this example.

[]{#anchor-256}***(I)***** am **[]{#anchor-257}**going to work –** vahm
orbate {va:m orbAt}

***(You)***** are going to work –** vahs orbate {va:s orbAt}

***(He/she/it)***** going to work –** vaht orbate {va:t orbAt}

***(We)***** are going to work –** vahmos orbate {vA:mos orbAt}

***(You)***** are going to work –** yu vahte orbate {yu va:t orbAt}

***(They)***** are going to work –** vahnt orbate {vA:nt orbAt}

FUTURE PERFECT
--------------

They are future events, but that already occurred in the mentioned
facts. Look an example below:

**When I return, he will have already left –** Quando reicsiem, is
habsiet ja likwn

Very similar to english.

SUBJUNCTIVE
-----------

It indicates desire or expectancy.

Only the verb “es” have the complete conjugation in this mode.

**Io sia {yo sya} –** []{#anchor-258}*(that I)* be

**Sias {syas} –** *(that you)* be

**Is/Ia/Id sia {is/ya/id sya} –** *(that he/she/it)* be

**Siam(o)s {syAm(o)s} –** *(that we)* be

**Siate {syat} –** *(that you)* be

**Siant {syant} –** *(that they)* be

All the other verbs only have the singular. The terminations are:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-259}**person singular:** -a

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -as

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -a

Per this termination you can make a negative imperative with the
prohibitive adverb “mae” {may}.

**Mae kaupas {may kAopas} –** “Don’t buy!” or “Thou shalt not buy!

IMPERATIVE
----------

It indicates an order or an ask.

The conjugation of the main verbs:

**Sdi {sdi} –** []{#anchor-260}be

**Estu {Estu} –** *(he/she/it)* be

**Smad ses {smad ses} –** let's be

**Ste {ste} –** be

**Sontu {sOntu} –** *(they)* be

**Hab(e) {hab} –** have

**Smad hab(e) {smad hab} –** let's have

**Habte {habt} –** have

**Woid(e) {woyd} –** know

**Smad woide {smad woyd} –** let's know

**Woidte {woydt} –** know

The imperative of the 2^nd^ person singular corresponds to the verbal
stem, with or without the final -e.

**Leave! –** linekw! {lInëkw} ou linkwe! {linkw}

**Eat this food –** edd tod anon {ed tod anOn}

In the 1^st^ person plural it's used the word “smad” *(let's)* with the
verb in the infinitive.

**Smad linkwes {smad lInkwës} –** let's leave

**Smad edde {smad ed} –** let's eat

In the 2^nd^ person plural, the form is the same used in the simple
present, but without the personal pronoun.

**Linkwte {lInkut} –** *(you)* leave !

**Eddte {edt} -** []{#anchor-261}(*you)* eat

CONDITIONAL
-----------

**Esiem {ezyEm} –** []{#anchor-262}*(I)* would be

**Esies {ezyEs} –** *(you)* would be

**Esiet {ezyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* would be

**Esiem(o)s {ezyEm(o)s} –** *(we)* would be

**Yu esiete {yu ezyEt} –** *(you)* would be

**Esient {ezyEnt} –** *(they)* would be

**Habiem {habyEm} –** []{#anchor-263}*(I)* would have

**Habies {habyEs} –** *(you)* would have

**Habiet {habyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* would have

**Habiem(o)s {habyEm(o)s} –** *(we)* would have

**Yu habiete {yu habyEt} –** *(you)* would have

**Habient {habyEnt} –** *(they)* would have

**Woidiem {woydyEm} –** []{#anchor-264}*(I)* would know

**Woidies {woydyEs} –** *(you)* would know

**Woidiet {woydyEt} –** *(he/she/it)* would know

**Woidiem(o)s {woydyEm(o)s} –** *(we)* would know

**Yu woidiete {woydyEt} –** *(you)* would know

**Woidient {woydyEnt} –** *(they)* would know

This verbal mood is made attaching the verbal stem + “ie” + conjugation
of the present.

[]{#anchor-265}***(I)***** would eat –** eddiem {edyEm}

***(You)***** would eat –** eddies {edyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** would eat –** eddiet {edyEt}

***(We)***** would eat –** eddiemos {edyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** would eat –** yu eddiete {yu edyEt}

***(They)***** would eat –** eddient {edyEnt}

### BUT WHAT ABOUT VERBS THAT ALREADY FINISH WITH “IE”?

Regarding these, replace “ie” for “icie”. Let's see the verb “edifie”
{edIfye}, which means “to edify”.

[]{#anchor-266}***(I)***** would edify –** edificiem {edifitsyEm}

***(You)***** would edify –** edificies {edifitsyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** would edify –** edificiet {edifitsyEt}

***(We)***** would edify –** edificiemos {edifitsyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** would edify –** yu edificiete {yu edifitsyEt}

***(They)***** would edify –** edificient {edifitsyEnt}

CATEGORIES OF VERBAL STEMS
--------------------------

Depending of the kind of verb, the stem may suffer changes, all of them
will be explained in this subchapter. Although I will talk a lot here
about participles, you don't need worry about them, it's still not
necessary to know how create them, it's enough to know that they are
nominal forms of the verb (like the past passive participle “eaten” that
comes from the verb “to eat”).

### NASAL INFIXES

From here to the final of this subchapter of **NASAL INFIXES**, the text
will be almost a transcription of the book *The Grammar Of
Sambahsa-Mundialect In English*, of Dr. Olivier Simon.

Are verbs with nasal infixes those with the following characteristics:

-   An unstressed “e” as last vowel and this “e” is between consonants
-   One of these consonants must be “m” or “n”

Let's work with the following words:

**Linekw {lInëkw} –** to leave

[]{#anchor-267}**Pressem {prEsëm} –** to press

[]{#anchor-268}**Scinesd {sInësd} –** to split (transitive)

[]{#anchor-269}**Annem {Anëm} –** to breathe

[]{#anchor-270}**Pregen {prEdjën} –** to imbue, to impregnate

In the present tense, and in all the tenses derived from the present
tense, the verbs lose their unstressed “e” when possible. If, with the
deletion of the “e”, a “s” or “ss” join to a consonant, they are deleted
too. Let's see the result of this:

Linkwo, linkws, linkwt, linkwm(o)s,yu linkwte, linkwnt {lInkunt}

Premo, prems, premt, premmos, yu premte, preme(nt)

Scindo, scinds, scindt, scindmos, yu scindte, scinde(nt)

Annmo, annems, annemt, annmmos, yu annemt, annment

(“annmt” and “annms” would be impronouncable)

Pregno {prEnyo}, pregens {prEdjëns}, pregent, pregnems {prEnyëms}, yu
pregent, pregne(nt)

All the verbs, with or without nasal infix, a “e” can be put between the
verbal stem and the conjugation for the word being pronounceble. Look
this case with the verb “storgn”.

Storgno, storgnes, storgnet, storgnems, yu storgnet, storgne(nt)

Verbs that have a unstressed “e” at the end are conjugated in the
following way:

Io entre, entres, entret, entrems, yu entret, entre(nt)

Yes, it's this what you've seen, the verb doesn't is conjugated in the
1^st^ person singular, that's why is compulsory the use of the pronoun
“io”.

Verbs whose last vowel is unstressed and is before a consonant follow
the same pattern:

Io hinder, hinders, hindert, hinderms, yu hindert, hindernt

It's “hinder” but not “hindere” because “hindere” would change the
accentuation {hindEr}

In the past tense and its derivatives, the verb, besides the lose of the
unstressed “e”, loses the nasal infix.

**Linekw –** likwim, likwist, likwit, likwam, likwat, likweer

**Pressem –** pressim, pressist, pressit, pressam, pressat, presseer

### ENDING WITH A STRESSED VOWEL

Verbs ended with a stressed vowel, or with a -h just after te vowel,
follow the pattern below:

**Infinitive: **duce {düts}

**Past tense:** duxim, ducst(a)/duxist, duxit, duxam, duxat, duxeer

You may say “ducim”, “ducit”… too. “duxim” was chosen here for
etimological reasons, because latin have dux- as the past of duc-.

**Past participle: **[]{#anchor-271}duct / ducen

The accentuation must stay in the same syllable for all persons in the
present tense.

In all the verbal moods, with exception of the nasal inffixes, the
unstressed “e” between two consonants, set that is at the end the word,
can be dropped if the junction of these two consonants doesn't change
the pronounciation of the first consonant.

VERBAL AFFIXES
--------------

Decidir abordar esse assunto só agora porque eu precisava que você
conhecesse gerúndios e pronomes reflexivos, pois eles serão usados nos
exemplos.

**bi- –** to begin to *(*[]{#anchor-272}*inchoative)*

**Id luce biattract insects –** The light begins to attract insects

**na- –** to keep on + *gerund (continuative)*

**Is nieudh urgent-ye namove –** He needed urgently to keep moving

**re- –** *as the re- of english*

**Ho tohrben rescribe mien buk –** I have had to rewrite my book

**vi- –** *corresponds to the English adverb “finally”*

**Is viemers ex id wed –** He finally emerged out of the water

**za- –** to stop doing

**Ibs sclavs buit permitten za-ermes –** The slaves were allowed to stop
rowing

### AFFIXES THAT CHANGE THE TENSE OF THE VERB

**ee- –** used to

**Hermann ee(-)gwaht id scol siens urb –** Hermann used to go to the
school of his town

Notice that the verb “gwaht” is in the present tense

**sa(l)- –** to be about to *+ verb* *(always written with hyphen)*

**Is wir sa-khierk –** The man was about to drown

**-skw –** to intend to do, to like to *(desiderative)* *(may be added
to verbs if it doesn't modify the accentuation of the verb)*

**Ies nauts gwahskweer id maykhana –** The sailors wanted to go to the
inn

**-eih –** *factive*

**Kaupeihm iom tod wogh –** I make him buy this car

Verbs ended in “ie” have this part replaced by “iceih”. Stems in “ei”
change this part for “i” because of euphonic reasons.

Pay attention that no all verb ended in “eih” is a factive, “credeih”
and “vergeih” are two examples.

This affix can be added to adjectives. “rudh” means “red”, “rudheih”
means “make (something) red”.

SOME LITERARY VERBAL FORMS
--------------------------

Due its indo-european heritage, sambahsa has some verbal forms that are
found only in the literary use.

### OPTIONAL ENDINGS OF THE PRESENT OF THE INDICATIVE

If it is compatible with the accentuation, the verbs can receive the
following terminations:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-273}**person singular:** -mi

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -si

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -ti

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -nti

**The verb “ses”:** esmi, essi, esti, sonti

The verb must be in the initial position of the sentence and this
sentence must not contain adverb, even a negation! This verbal formation
only must describe the events that actually occurs, no for general
statements. These consitions are rarely fulfilled.

[]{#anchor-274}[]{#anchor-275}**Stahnti medsu iens peinds –** here they
stand amidst the enemies

**Acquiseihmi denars kay likes videogames –** I gain money for playing
videogames

### OLD FORMS OF THE IMPERATIVE

In the 2^nd^ person singular of the imperative, a option may be the use
of the suffix -di to the stem of the verb. Don't forget in changing “eu”
and “ei” for respectively “u” and “i” and observe the nasal infix.

**Kludi! –** listen! *instead* “kleu(e)!”

**Ihdi! –** go! *instead* “eih(e)!”

A imperative in the 3^rd^ persons is possible suffixing the -u to the
conjugated verb, it it doesn't change the accentuation.

**Is maurdher nehct –** the murderer perishs

**Is maurdher nehctu! –** let the murderer perish!

**I slougs behrnt gwaur bermens –** the servants carry heavy burdens

**I slougs behrntu gwaur bermens! –** let the servants carry heavy
burdens!

It's possible to use the stem of the verb with the final -e and a
subject in the sentence:

**Gwive is roy! –** long live the king!

### PARTICIPLE IN THE FUTURE

To make the participle it's used the sintetic form of the future plus
the termination -nd.

**gwehmsie + nd = **[]{#anchor-276}**gwehmsiend –** []{#anchor-277}*what
or who* will be coming

The near future is marked with the termination “tur”, for making it:

-   Add -ur for the verbs in participle that follow the Von Wahl rules,
    or that ends with “v”.

**Cedd –** cessur (going to yield)

**Emov –** emotur (going to emote)

-   Add -ur for the 3^rd^ person singular in the present.

**Baht –** bahtur (going to speak)

The active future of the verb “ses” is “butur”.

### THE OLD FORMATIONS OF THE INFINITIVE

Formations of the old infinitive are possible in two ways: following the
same base of the active future seen before (the use of the passive
participle in “t” or of the 3^rd^ person singular of present), if it
doesn't modify the accentuation.

The first formation ends with -(t) and express the idea of proposal.

**Abgwahsit pinctum in id widu –** he goes off to paint in the
timberland

**Gwehmo essum con vos –** I come to eat with you

Substantived verbs.

**Deictum exact reuls sienims almens –** showing exact rules to one’s
pupils

**sienims =** “sien” + dative plural “ims”

The other endings ends with -tu and may be translated as “to be …-ed”.
It appears often after qualitative adjectives.

**Un garden amat spehctu –** A garden *(that is)* pleasant to be looked
at

Sometimes it appears as a ajective of obligation.

**Ia kwehrtu opsa** – the tasks to be done

### THE DURATIVE

The durative suffix -neu corresponds to actions that started in the past
and continues until the present, it includes situations where normally
it would be used words like “since” or “for”.

**Stahneum her pon trigim minutes –** I’ve been standing here for thirty
minutes

The past tense is made with ee-.

**Eeghangneut apter iom pon Orleans –** he had been walking behind him
since Orleans

### THE EVENTIVE

It means “not to stop doing”, it consists in repeat the fist consonant
(or sC, Cw, Cy or Cv) before the stem with the addiction of i- or ei-.
The imperfect tense is made with ee-.

**Dehm *****(to tame/to put upright)***** –** didehm *(to tame/to put upright *without stoping*)*

### THE INTENSIVE

It means “to do little by little”. It consists in the duplication od the
stem (with the deletion of clusives in the middle). Rarely used. The
imperfect tense is made with ee-.

**Wehrt →** wehrwehrt

### THE ITERATIVE

It means “to start to keep on doing”. There is apofonies to be observed:

**eh:** oh

**ei:** oi

**eu:** ou

You use the suffix -ye. The imperfect tense is made with ee-.

[]{#anchor-278}**Kwehr- sien itner –** to make one's way

**Kwohrye- sien itner –** *it indicates that the action was stopped for
a time (for example: for the agent to rest) and it continues this action
later. It not would be like in “rekwehr- sien itner”, which indicates
that all the action is being remade.*

### THE PERFECT

It represents an action made in the past whose effects or consequences
still have an influence in the present. It's made preffixing the first
letter of the stem followed by the “e” and then the verb conjugated in
the past.

[]{#anchor-279}**Lelikwst id vetus wastu –** thou hast left the olde
city []{#anchor-280}*(“lelikwst” comes from the verb “linekw”)*

MORE ABOUT THE USE OF THE DECLINATIONS
======================================

As you already know the verbs, I feel more comfortable to teach you more
about the declinations.

ACCUSATIVE
----------

It’s very easy, some examples:

**I have all the husbands –** ho vasyens mann(en)s

**I am sorry, but I’ve began to love another woman –** maaf, bet ho
biliubht alyu gwen

**biliubht =** bi (verbal affix that means “to begin to”) + liubht
(participle in the past)

DATIVE
------

**Manoel gives honey to the bears –** Manoel daht mielt im urxims\
**I’ve bought a present to my wife –** ho kaupen un hadia mieni esori\
**I make furnitures for the houses –** kwehro meublar ibs domims

ADVERBS
=======

Adverbs are words that qualifies a verb, like in “traveled quietly” and
“ate a lot”, where the verbs “traveled” and “ate” are qualified by the
adverbs “quietly” and “a lot”. For making a adverb you have to add the
suffix -ye (with hyphen!!!). Look some examples:

**End –** end, final

**End-ye –** finally

**Enpace –** peaceful

**Enpace-ye –** peacefully

It’s can be said that the -ye is like the -ly of english. But, in the
same way as english, not all adverbs ends with the same ending, because
some words are adverbs by itselves, look some examples:

**Tik –** only

**Ops –** often

**Just –** just

***Ho just nicen un wir –** I’ve just killed a man*

**Just barwakt –** just in time

**It(han) {it / i§An} –** so, this way

**Bfuyi {bfUyi} –** forever

**Sigwra {sIgura} –** definitely, surely

**Oku {Oku} –** quickly

**Ja** **{ja} –** already

**Semper {sEmpër} –** always

**Tun {tun} –** then

**(Ya)schi {(yA)ci} –** too

Adverbs also can be made by adding the preffix a- to substantives.

**Part –** part

**Top(p) –** top

**Apart –** apart

**Atop –** atop

Adverbs of quality like “baygh” and “pior” may behave like adjectives
when they refer to a substantive, they may have (it’s not compulsory) a
declesional final, but as an adverb (with the possible adjunction of the
-ye) when they refer to an attributive adjective.

**Piora kowpic chifans sont vierdnic pro sieune –** too many copious
meals are harmful for health

**Pior-ye kowpic chifans sont vierdnic pro sieune –** too much copious
meals are harmful for health

GERUND
======

In order to make the gerund it’s used the active participle plus the
suffix -ye (with hyphen!). It’s very simple, but english speakers must
pay a bit of attention here, because you already saw that the sentence
“I am eating” is translated as “som eddend”, but no “som eddend-ye”!
With the verb “ses”, you only use the active participle in the present,
in all the other cases you use the gerund. Look some examples:

**He ate the cake looking at me –** Is essit id torte spehcend-ye me

**They *****(women)***** died working –** Ias mohreer orbatend-ye

If I’ve wrote “Is essit id torte spehcend me” *(without the -ye in the
gerund)* it would mean that is the cake that is looking me, I hope that
with this example you’ve learned how to difference better the gerund of
the active participle in the present.

If it facilitates the understanding: the two examples above may be
translated like “he ate the cake *while* he looked at me” and “they died
*while* they are working”.

REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS AND THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUN “SIEN”
====================================================

The pronouns are: “se” (accusative), “sib” (dative) and “sien”
(possessive pronoun).

**Se vidmos in id specule –** we see ourselves in the mirror

**“…”, sib sieyg is lytil prince –** “…”, said the little prince to
himself

The pronoun “sien” refers to the subject of the sentence, but never
appears together the nominal group of the subject.

**Un pater alt sien purts –** a father raises his children

**Julio ed eyso prient siefreer do Brasilu –** Julio and his friend
traveled to Brazil

Notice that it couldn’t be “Julio ed sien prient”, remember of what was
said before.

The “self” is translated as -swo, look:

**Gnohdi teswo –** Know thyself

Ah, it’s opportune to say that “each other” is translated to “mutu” in
sambahsa.

**Martin ed eyso prient tolke con mutu in Sambahsa –** Martin and his
friend talk to each other in sambahsa

**RELATIVE PRONOUN AND INTEGRANT CONJUNCTION**
==============================================

Look the sentences below, look at the use of the word “que”:

\(1) This is the horse *that* I bought

\(2) I had a daughter *that* wanted to be singer

\(3) I’ve said *that* I don’t like coffee

\(4) He is so lazy *that* his parents put wheels in his bed

Although thy are the same word, they have different functions.

The “that”s of the sentences (1) and (2) are relative pronouns, because
they are related to some substantive used before, in the case of the
sentence (1) is “horse” and in the sentence (2) is “daughter”.

The “that”s of the sentences (3) and (4) are integrant conjunctions,
because they start a new sentence.

Perhaps you already know the relative pronouns, because they are in that
list of cases of declination, only pay attention about what case to use,
because the “that” of the sentence (1) is a direct object (of the verb
“bought”) while the “that” of the sentence (2) is a subject.

**This is the horse *****that***** I bought – **Tel est el cavall *quel*
kieupim

**I had a daughter *****that***** wanted to be singer –** hiebim un
dugter *qua* iskwit ses sehngver

The integrant conjuction is often translated as “od”.

**I’ve said *****that***** I don’t like coffee –** Ho saygen *od* ne
kamo cofie

**He thought *****that***** I am from Africa –** is mohnit *od* som ex
Africa

As sometimes only a conjunction is not clear enough to indicate whether
what was said is a desire or a claim, there is also the integrant
conjunction “ke” (or “kem”), which express a desire and may be used in
the place of “od”.

**I desire that he learns sambahsa –** vanscho kem is euct Sambahsa

**That our team win the enemy team and become the european soccer champion
–** Ke nies swoin vinct id peindswoin ed biht Europes football champion

**Let’s fake that the glass have become so soft as gauze to we can go
the on the other side –** smad simule kem id glas hat biht tem moll quem
kaz kay ghehdiemos lites ocolo

**I ask you to leave –** te prehgo ke linkws

THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS “YO(S)”, “YA” AND “YOD”
---------------------------------------------

I thought a lot if I really should bring this subject here, because, as
you’ll see, pratically you’ll not use them, but as this is a *complete*
grammar, I felt in the obligation of explaining them.

Basically the relation is:

**Qui –** yo(s)

**Qua – **ya

**Quod –** yod

The relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod are to make independent sentences,
how? Look the example below:

**Latif, yo gwivt in Afghanistan, baht Sambahsa –** Latif, who lives in
Afghanistan, speaks sambahsa

Notice that even we remove the “yo gwivt in Afghanistan” (“who lives in
Afghanistan”), the sentence wouldn’t lose its meaning, once “Latif baht
Sambahsa” still pass the same message? We can understand the relative
pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod insert an information merely additional that –
gramatically speaking – can be omitted.

Now let’s see an example that the relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod
wouldn’t be useful.

**Id bahsa, quod Latif baht, est Sambahsa –** the language, which Latif
speaks, is sambahsa

If we remove the “quod Latif baht” (“which Latif speaks”), the sentence
would lose its original meaning.

You would question me: “but I could use there relative pronouns a lot
that you say be rarely used, because I make a lot of sentences where
they fit”.

But the detail is that you could use the pronouns qui/qua/quod in the
place of yo(s)/ya/yod, would be perfectly valid a sentence like: “Latif,
qui gwivt in Afghanistan, baht Sambahsa”

The only reason to use the relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod would be for
literary proposals.

QUESTIONS
=========

There are diverse ways for making a question, the first one is adding
the word “kwe” {kwe} at the beginning of the sentence.

**Kwe ghehdo ghende tod? –** can I hold it?

**Kwe siem ghehdo ghende tod? –** could I hold it?

**Kwe ter sont leuds her? –** are there people here?

**Kwe sont leuds her? –** are there people here?

The “kwe” also may be used at the end of question together the “no” with
the role of “isn’t”, “aren’t”, “wasn’t”, etc.

**Safersiemos do ia Uniet Stats, kwe no? –** we will travel to United
States, wont?

You also can make a question inverting the position of the main verb.

**Ghehdo io ghende tod? –** can I hold it?

**Siem io ghehde ghende tod? –** can I hold it?

Notice that is necessary the use of the pronoun.

**Sont ter leuds her? –** are there people here?

Notice that is necessary the use of the “ter”.

Questions with “what”, “who”, “when” and other similar pronouns, you can
make a question in the same way you do in english.

**Quis ste yu? –** who are you? *(question made for a male person)*

**Quando safersies –** when you travel?

NEGATION
========

To answer a question in a negative form, you can simply say “no”.

To create a negative verb, it’s enough to put the “ne” before the verb.

**Ne eddo leckereits –** I don’t eat candies

The “mae” {may} is a prohibitive.

**Mae eddo leckereits –** I shouldn’t eat sweeties

**Mae eddas leckereits –** “don’t eat sweeties” or “thou shalt not eat
sweeties” *(don’t you understand the reason of the ending -as in the
verb “edd”? Remember the reason in the chapter about the subjunctive
verb)*

To facilitate, just remember those biblical commandments:

**Mae neicas –** You shall not murder

We may not forget the verb “I am not able to” that is “khako” {qAko}.

**Khako kaupe un wogh –** I can’t buy a car

“Khak” is the antonymous of “ghehd”.

ABOUT THE USE OF THE “SI”
-------------------------

In order to have not doubts regarding the use of the “si”, which means
“yes” and is used to answer negative questions. Observe the following
situation:

**Ne has tu purts? –** don’t you have children?

Si

The “si” doesn’t confirm the thought of who asks, in other words.

**Ne has tu purts? –** don’t you have children?

**Si, ho purts –** yes, I have children

AVOIDING REPETITIONS
====================

In a conversation, may occur we need to use a noun already used just
before, to avoid the repetition of words sambahsa offers basically the
same resources as english. Look the examples:

If you like tea, I can give you *some*

Sei tu kams chay, vahm tib schehnke *sem*

I bring the tea and its cups.

Please, give me *one*!

Bringho id chay ed ia tasses.

Plais, schehnk mi *uno*!

A course of faculty is composed by diverse subjects, and *each one* has
a certain quantity of hours

**U**n facultat curs est composen ab/med multa matiers, ed *ielg* hat un
certain quantitat om hors

Take your book and pass *mine*

Ghendte vies buk ed anancte mi *mieno*

You could say just “mien” or “id mien”, but “mieno” makes the message
more clear

Which T-shirt are you going to use?

I am going to use *my newer one*

Qualg tischert vahte yu vehse?

Vahm vehse *mien nov(er)*

My little fish is like of the neighbor*’s one* before die

Mien lytil pisk est lik *tal* ios nieber pre mehre

Here the complete sentence: Mien lytil pisk est lik al pisk ios
nieber pre mehre

PARTICIPLES
===========

Participles are the nominal form of the verb.

ACTIVE PRESENT
--------------

For forming the active participle of the present, it’s enough to add the
suffix -(e)nd *(-(e)nt is possible too, but rarely used because it can
make confusion with the third person of the plural)*.

Using the verb “to be” plus the participle plus the active participle of
the present for making sentences like:

**Id sol eet bleigend –** the sun was shining

**Id bleigend sol –** the shining sun

**Es –** esend

**Hab –** Habend

**Woid –** woidend

In theory the participles can be used as substantives, but actually it
never occurs, what happens is the use of endings like -(e)nt and -(a)nt,
like in “president”, “studyent” and “immigrant”.

ACTIVE PAST
-----------

For forming the active participle of the past, it’s enough to add the
suffix -us or -vs *(it’ll depend of what gives the better pronunciation
to the word and of its accentuational patterns)*.

**Dank spollay ob gwehmus hetro –** thank you very much for coming here

**Ia minst antslehnkus lands –** the less developed countries

**Es –** esus

**Hab –** Habus

**Woid –** woidus

PASSIVE PRESENT
---------------

Of the passive participles, sambahsa uses only the past, but it’s
possible to use the passive present in composed words. The suffix is
-men with the stem of the verb in the present.

**Al –** raise *(in the sense of raise a child)*

**Almen –** pupil

PASSIVE PAST
------------

For forming the passive participle, it’s enough to add the suffix -t or
-(e)n. I judge this participle the most interesting and you understand
why.

**Es –** est / esen *(been)*

**Hab –** habt / haben *(had)*

**Woid –** wois / woiden *(known)*

### OTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING THE PAST TENSE, THE PRESENT PERFECT

It’s the same as in English but the Sambahsa tense can refer to actions that don't 
last anymore, even if they still have consequences.

**Ho edden –** I’ve eaten

**Ho kaupen –** I’ve bought

**Has liubhen / liubht –** you’ve loved

**Habte yu edden? / –** have you eaten?

**Habte yu kaupen? / –** have you bought?

### A WAY OF MAKING ADJECTIVES WITH VERBS

Let’s use the following verbs and substantives in the examples:

**Sneigv {sneygv} –** snow

**Calive {kalIv} –** cabin

**Lyegher {lyEgër} –** layer

**Tenu {tEnu} –** thin

**Myehrs {mye:rs} – **to forget

**Covehr {kovE:r} –** to cover

**Covohr {kovO:r} –** *verb “covehr” in the past. In the next chapter
I’ll explain why it occurs.*

Now let’s see the application of the participles:

**Myohrsen land –** forgotten land

**Uno sneigvcovohrn calive –** a snow-covered cabin

**Un calive covohrno med un tenu sneigvlyegher –** A cabin covered with
a thin snow-layer

CONJUNCTIONS AND OTHER INVARIABLE WORDS
=======================================

As in this chapter as in the next chapter, the one about the
prepositions, I’ll work in the following way: I’ll show some direct
translations of the words, nut in the examples I may represent these
invariable words from sambahsa by words or expressions of the english
language that I didn’t show in the direct translation. How? I’ll talk
about the invariable word “yeji”, which is translated as “according to”,
but in the examples I did not use this translation! I did it
deliberately with the goal of showing you that you have to learn the
idea behind the words, not merely their direct translations!

Don’t be afraid with the size of this chapter, I only aimed to put all
the invariable words here, in what way to this grammar be a good
reference material.

SOME DOUBTS THAT CAN APPEAR
---------------------------

### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “BET” AND “MEN”?

While “bet”, the most common, presents a real opposition, “men” doesn't
present real oposition. Look the examples below:

**(1) Ne eddo **[]{#anchor-283}**leckereits, MEN ne som diabetic –** I
don't eat candies, but I am not diabetic

**(2) Ia orbat in un kiekwrschop, MEN ia ne est veterinar –** she works
in a pet shop, but she is not veterinar

**(3) Kamo sports, BET ne som un athlete –** I like sports, but I am not
an athlete

**(4) Gwivs in id eust, BET eiskws gwive in id west –** you live in the
east, but you want to live in the west

Observe that, in (1), if I don't eat candies, it doesn't necessarly mean
that I am diabetic; in (2) the woman works in a pet shop, but she
doesn't have to be veterinar to work there. But in (3), if I say that I
like sports, many people may presume that I am an athlete; in (4) the
person lives in the east, so it's assumed that he/she wanted to live
there, but in reality his/her desire is otherside.

Don't worry so much, because the choose between “men” and “bet” is very
*subjective*, some can say that if you work in a pet shop, much probably
you are a veterinar, thus we should use “bet” instead “men” in (2). In
(3), if you live in a place where people like sports a lot, but it's
common that almost nobody practice such activities, “men” can be used.

PREPOSITIONS
============

Preposições são palavras que estabelecem uma relação, do tipo
subordinativa, entre dois termos de uma oração. A maioria das
preposições do sambahsa podem ser usadas como conjunções também. As
preposições são:

**Ab {ab} –** de *(após particípio passivo).* Essa preposição se torna
“af” quando antes de palavra que inicie com “h”. Também pode significar
“a partir de”, “começando de”

**Id torte buit edden ab me –** o bolo foi comido por mim

**Af hoyd –** a partir de hoje

ser usado.*

significa “ser/estar difícil”, por isso que foi necessário o uso do “ad”

SOME DOUBTS THAT CAN APPEAR
---------------------------

I tried to explain well the prepositions in the examples, I even used
very similar examples I order to evidence the differences, but some
doubts can remain. In this subchapter I try to predict some of them and
I try to answer them.

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “MED” AND “PER”

What's the difference between the twho sentences below?

**Is magician hat construgen un castell med sien magia –** the magician
have built a castle with his magic

**Is magician hat construgen un castell per sien magia – **the magician
have built a castle through his magic

The second sentence is gramatically correct, but it gives the impression
that the magician have build the castle with he in other dimension or
distant place, while in the first sentence the magician have build the
castle in the place where he was. Look whether with the example below
you can understand:

Glego per id fenster med mien durbin iam bikini-vehsend gwenak

I ogle through the window with my binoculars the bikini-weared young
woman

Did you notice why my second example *(the one of the magician who have
built the castle “per” his magic)* was strange?

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “POS” AND “TRANS”

“Pos” is initially an adverb, in other words, if you say a sentence like
the one below:

**Id urb est pos id forest –** the city is after the forest

The sentece above means something like: first it's necessary cross the
forest before reachingthe city.

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “EX” AND “UD”

Let's see three examples:

**Som ex Uniet Stats –** I am from United States

**Un helm ex stal –** a helmet of steel

**Un brev ud Klara –** a letter carta from Klara

The “ex”, when not in the sense of “out”, is used for something made
from the mencioned object or came from it, like a helmet of steel or a
person from a country. The “ud” is used for things that didn't come from
within the mencioned object, like we don't expect that the letter was
made from the body of Klara, so we use “ud” instead “ex”.

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “VICE” AND “INSTET”

As prepositions both means the same thing, but “intet” can be also a
adverb while “vice” also can be a preffix, like in “vice-president”.

Henrique ne hat ghohden dake ia buks. *Instet*, Olivier hat ei yist ia
odt-documents

Henrique ne hat ghohden dake ia buks. *Vice to*, Olivier hat ei yist ia
odt-documents

“GE”, “NU”, “TAR”, “TUN”
========================

They're not simple words to be translated, but this chapter will teach
you how to use them.

The word “tun” is the demonstrative of “kun” or “quando”.

**Herodotos extendt tod nam do id continental hinterland, beuwend it
Asia id trit part ios gnoht mundios tun –** Herodot extends this name to
the continental hinterland, making thus of Asia the third part of the
known world then* (at that time)*

“nu” can work in opposition to “de”. Basically it means “namely”.

**Un public wesnum est un contracto conclus ab un contragend magh, nu id
Stat, ia regional au local autoritats –** a public procurement is a
contract concluded by a contracting authority, namely/that is to say the
State, the regional or local authorities (etc …)

“ge” and “tar” are like “ghi”, but as, sometimes, the repetition of the
particle “ghi” occurs very repeatedly, it's used these two particles.
“ge” emphasizes personal pronouns and articles, while “tar” emphasize
interrogative pronouns.

An excelent example with “nu” and “tar”:

**Sei nu id luce quod est in te est temos, kam tar megil sessiet tod
temos! –** if, therefore, the light that is in thee there are, how large
are such darkness!

USEFUL AFFIXES
==============

Differently of other auxiliary languages, sambahsa rely more on borrowed
words than composed words. Sambahsa has so many languages as sources
that is impossible to have a regular system of derivation, but some
useful affixes can be listed.

Some basic rules can be considered in forms derived from the romance
languages, an important characteristic of theirs is that they're based
on the “perfect stem”, which is predicted in the following ways:

For verbs ending with unstressed “e”, it's used -at- instead.

form*e* → form*at*- → formation

For verbs ending with “ie”, it's used -icat- instead.

publ*ie* → publ*icat-* → publication

For verbs ending with “ue”, it's used -ut- instead. It also is applied
to verbs whose past participles in “t” ends with -wt.

constit*ue* → constitut*ut-* → constitution

For verbs ending with “eih”, it's used -it- instead.

add*eih* → add*it-* → addition

The perfect stem of other verbs corresponds to their participles in “t”.

SUFFIXES
--------

### EXPRESSING QUALITY OR STATE

**Deub \[döb\] (deep) –** dube \[düb\] (deepness)

**Slab \[slab\] (weak) –** sliebe \[slyeb\] (eakness)

This systen only works if there is a phonetics differenc between the
adjective and the derived form. For other adjectives is used the suffix
-(e)t.

**Mild \[mild\] (mild) –** mildet \[mildEt\] (pity)

**Mynder \[mÜndër\] (proud) –** Myndert \[mündErt\] (pride)

It's possible the use of others affixes like -os and -ia. For words of

### EXPRESSING AN ACTION

Se o próprio radical verbal não é o suficiente, a terminação -(e)n pode
ser adicionada *(ou -sa para verbos terminados em som de vogal acentuada
tonicamente)*. Verbos de origem românica adiciona-se -(t)ion ao radical
verbal.

### INDICATING THE EXECUTOR OF AN ACTION

The most used is -er, very similar to english. A pratical set is -ant
for who makes the action, -eit for who suffers this action and -at to

STYLE
=====

Do you know what is idiotism? It's is a linguistic term used to describe
terms that are only used in a determined language, if they were directly
translated to other language, they wont have any sense. I'll show you
some examples from the french language:

**Cherchez la femme –** police slang for situations when there is a
complication and nobody knows who was the responsible. In a literal
translation it is “look for the woman”

**Pourboire –** it's our tip *(the extra money that we give to the
waiter)*. In direct translation it is “for drinking”.

It's not like the idiotisms are untranslable, it's their direct
translation that is unfeasible. Are understanding what I am trying to
say?

Different of the national languages, which have native speakers inserted
in a determined social context, sambahsa is to be spoken between people
of different backgrounds. An mongolian will find difficulties in
understanding a person who speaks in the german way.

I am not saying that you have to speak a poor and personalityless
sambahsa! But you have to be aware in avoiding idiotisms and other forms
of speaking that are proper of americans or british.

**What I am trying to say is:** talk in a simple way, but without lose
the personality that the language allows us to have and the richness
that it offer us.

CHOOSING NEW WORDS
==================

The primary source is, surely, what was reconstructed from the ancestor
indo-european. As not all words were reconstructed, many of them can be
obtained from indo-european ancient languages like sanskrit, ancient
greek and latin.

Other sources are borrowed words of, at least, two linguistic branchs,
from West Europe until East Asia.

There is no reason to worry about new words, sambahsa already have a
great lexicon and new words will come from the absortion of neologisms.
If it's not possible a translation from the existent lexicon in
sambahsa, can be used the word in its original form, the terms from the
computer science area are a good example of this. Words that imply a
specific cultural item, like a martial arts of a people or a typical
dish, will be used the own word. It's similar what would happen in
english, for example, the word 武術 *(wushu)* was translated in the
nearest way to what is pronounced in the original, respecting the limits
of the english language that doesn't have the intonations of chinese and
other different sounds.

As you can see, naturally that the new words have to be adapted to the
orthography of sambahsa, which due its flexibility tries at best
maintain the words in their form and original pronounce.

COMMON MISTAKES AND DOUBTS
==========================

In all this grammar I tried to explain all the details of the language,
but always may exist something that someone have not understood. So I've
created this chapter for listing all the mistakes and doubts I had
throughout my learning of sambahsa, I hope that this chapter be useful
for you.

Obviously that will be added here, in future versions of this grammar,
doubts of other people.

WHAT REALLY MEANS THE VERB “LEIT”
---------------------------------

It means “to go, to run” in the figurative sense.

**Is vohs un armur quod baygh duslit ei –** he wore an armor that wasn't
good in him

**duslit = **dus (preffix for “bad” or “ill-”) + lit (past tense of
“leit”)

**In ielg poesis, lit meis au minter dayir pisk –** In each poetry, the
matter was more or less about fish

**Kam leitte yu? –** How are you? *(*or* “how are you going?”)*

**Bet tod conversation leit lyt pior oku –** but this conversation is
going a bit very quickly

**Id grance leit engwn id Rhen –** the boundaries goes along the Rhine

HOW ASK SOMETHING TO SOMEONE
----------------------------

How translate “I asked my father for money”. The most correct
translation is *not* “prohgim denars ad mien pater”, let's see the
problems of this sentence. The sentence in its passive form:

**\* Denars buir prohgen ab me ud mien pater –** money was prayed to me
by my father

Remember that the verb “prehg”, in the sense of “ask something to
someone” is used with the word “ke(m)” and in this case should be used
the “ud” instead “ad”. Let's see how would be the translation of this
absurd sentence.

**\* Prohgim denars ad mien pater –** I prayed to money for my father

Now see the sentence how it should be translated:

**I asked my father for money –** prohgim mien pater ke mi daht denars
*(**literally:** I asked my father that he give me money)*

Notice that “mi” is in the dative case

HOW TO SAY WHETHER SOMETHING WILL BE DELAYED OR BE LATE?
--------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with the verb “chitay”. You can make sentences like:

**Tod saat chitayt –** this clock is late

**Id machine chitayt pre schalte –** the machine is delaying to start
*(**in direct translation:** “the machine delays before starting”. You
mustn't use “kay” here)*

How the transitive verb “chitay” may be used with persons:

**Id seuy hat chitayt mien prient –** the rain has delayed my friend

You can use the adjective “skept”.

**Mien prient est skept ob id seuy –** my friend is late due the rain

There are several forms of expressing an idea:

**Id machine tehrpt wakt pre biwehrge –** the machine needs time before
it start to work

VERBS OF DIRECTION LIKE “GWAH”
------------------------------

Verbs like “gwah” (to go to) dispense prepositions, because their direct
objects already informate that they are the direction of movement. The
preposition may serve to informe something more, like in the examples
below:

**Vahm gwahe kye mien dom –** I am going to my house *(I am going to the
house, but I don't plain to enter into it)*

**Vahm gwahe mien dom –** I am going to my house *(I enter into the
houseentro na casa)*

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN “YAKIN” AND “WEIDWOS”?
----------------------------------------------------

While “yakin” is an adjective, “weidwos” is an adverb.

Always pay attention in the dictionary to the gramatical
classificationof the words.

VOCABULARY
==========

You've learned much of what you need for using this beautiful language
called sambahsa. I'll not be unmodest in affirm that I've passed all
that can be taught, even the auxiliary languages requires volumes and
more volumes if they were taught deeply, but I hope that this grammar
had taught you to use the language in at least 99,90% of the situations.

This last chapter has as goal expand a bit more your vocabulary, it's
obvious that I'll not teach all words, because this book would have to
be also a dictionay for this task be possible, but I want that you
finish this book with a reasonable vocabulary, in order to you can
initiate the reading of the texts with a bit of comfort.

There are several subchapters that treats several areas, like human body
and computers, but it will be just basic concepts, there is no a
pretence here in to list the names in sambahsa of all muscles and bones
of the human body, similarly that all names of Information Technology;
you'll have to search the words in a dictionary or, in the case of very
specific terms, in dictionaries about a specific area like dicionaries
of medical terms.

Also is important pay attention in which subchapter the words are found
in order to you don't have unnecessary doubts about the actual meaning
of the words. I wanna avoid situations like you see the word “musch”,
whose translation is “fly”, and you think that it means the verb “to
fly”; if this word is in the subchapter ANIMALS, probably it refers to
an insect of the order Diptera instead of that action that airplanes do.
Resumming: through the subchapter where the word is found you can deduce
in what context this word can be used.

Actually for you expand your vocabulary – and consolidate your
knowledges of grammar – it's essential that you read, listen and
practise the language.

COMPUTING
---------

As certain terms, especially acronyms, from the english language have
wide acceptation in the world, maybe it's more convenient to use the
original terms, like VGA, which in sambahsa is VGT. Well, do what you
think that is the better.

Do you remember what I told about the verbs in the infinitive form? If
not, please go back to the subchapter VERBS in this chapter VOCABULARY.

If you want to translate a software to sambahsa and don't know whether
you should translate the commands to the infinitive form or imperative
form, see here the explanation of how it must be made:

-   Commands given to the computer by the user are translated in the
    infinitive form. ***Example:** abonne id forum *(subscribe in the
    forum)*; rename archive *(rename file)*; yises blixbrev *(send
    email)
-   Commands given to the user by the computer are translated in the
    imperative form, with the "courtesy" formula of the 2nd person plural.
    ***Example:** contancte nos *(contact us)*; clickte her
    *(click here)*; yeiste nos un blixbrev *(send us an email)
