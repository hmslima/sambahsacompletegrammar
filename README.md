# Sambahsa Mundialect - Complete Grammar

***Sambahsa Mundialect** is an auxiliary language created by the French Dr. Olivier Simon, it was launched in the internet on July of 2007, its base is the proto-Indo-European language, language spoken about 5000 years ago, whose daughter languages widespread from Southern Russia up to the British Isles and India. Sambahsa counts with many contributions from other languages, especially Arabic, but also Chinese, Indonesian and many others.*

This project aims to develop a friendly complete grammar book for Sambahsa Mundialect available in various languages, the original book is in Brazilian Portuguese, revisers for the translated books are very welcome.

**ATTENTION 1:** Since the formartting capacities of MarkDown are very limited and text formatting matters a lot, in order to preserve all the original formatting of the texts, which are in the original .odt files, the MD files only will be used to show the changes made by the contributors, the real changes will be made in the .odt files that you can download from the [ODT folder](https://github.com/hmslima/sambahsacompletegrammar/tree/master/ODT).

**ATTENTION 2:** The ODF files use two fonts that maybe are not installed in your system, they are *Great Vibes* and *Lingua Franca*, so I suggest that you install the fonts from the [fonts folder](https://github.com/hmslima/sambahsacompletegrammar/tree/master/fonts). In very few parts I use the font DejaVu Serif, but it comes with LibreOffice and even if you don't have this font, maybe your system make a replacement.
