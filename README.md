# Sambahsa Mundialect - Complete Grammar

***Sambahsa Mundialect** is an auxiliary language created by the French Dr. Olivier Simon, it was launched in the internet on July of 2007, its base is the proto-Indo-European language, language spoken about 5000 years ago, whose daughter languages widespread from Southern Russia up to the British Isles and to India. Sambahsa counts with many contributions from other languages, especially Arabic, but also Chinese, Indonesian and many others.*

This project aims to create a friendly complete grammar book about Sambahsa Mundialect, this book started as a translation from the original book in Brazilian Portuguese and now both versions are maintained and updated together.

The book still is in its beta phase, but it already can be used since most of the rules are exposed with many examples. You find the most current version in the file [sambahsa.md](/sambahsa.md), but maybe you find better to read the version in pdf that you can find in the [release's page](https://github.com/hmslima/sambahsacompletegrammar/releases).

Although my updates and contributions of others are made in the sambahsa.md file, I also put all the updates in an .odt file in order to create a well formatted .pdf file.


**ATTENTION:** Since the formartting capacities of MarkDown are very limited and text formatting matters a lot, in order to preserve all the original formatting of the text, which is in the original .odt file, the file sambahsa.md only will be used to show the changes made by the contributors, the real changes will be made in the .odt file that you can download from this github page.
