[]{#anchor}INTRODUCTION
=======================

**Sambahsa Mundialect** is an auxiliary language created by the French
Dr. Olivier Simon and launched on the internet on July 2007. Its base is
Proto-Indo-European, a reconstructed language[^1] spoken about 5000
years ago, whose daughter languages are widespread from Southern Russia
up to the British Isles and India. Sambahsa also counts with many
contributions from other languages, especially Arabic, but also Chinese,
Indonesian, and many others.

As it is an auxiliary language, Sambahsa is much easier than any
national language like Spanish or German, but Sambahsa is a bit more
challenging if it\'s compared to other auxiliary languages because it is
a bit complicated at the beginning. However, after that, the learning
process shows itself incredibly simple and the advantages of its
complexity will make all the effort be worth it, especially for
expressing the thought and translation.

Before we go any further, let me explain why I use the term "national
language" to refer to languages like English and Spanish instead of
"natural language". I speak "national language" because there is no
global generic version of a language, many non‑anglophones learn the
English from either the United States or England[^2]. In the same way,
many people study either the Spanish language from Spain or the one from
a Latin American country. I know, at first, you can study variants from
different countries, but your speech will not seem natural if you mix
words, pronunciations, and ways of speaking from different cultures, so
you will have to choose the variant of a country sooner or later.
Regarding the problematic of the term "natural language", it is clear
that languages like English and Spanish are natural, in no way am I
denying this, even an illiterate person can communicate in his native
language. But these languages have a certain degree of artificiality,
otherwise, we would not spend years in elementary and high school
studying our language, not to mention that even those who have finished
school still make minor spelling and grammar mistakes. I avoid using the
expression "natural language", because I would have to speak --
explicitly or not -- of its opposite, the "artificial language". Yes,
Sambahsa is an artificial language, but if I say "Sambahsa is an
artificial language", many people may understand that Sambahsa would not
sound natural, which would be wrong, as the process of using Sambahsa is
the same as using Spanish or French, with the difference that you would
not need to worry about the constant irregularities of these national
languages.

With what the language looks like? The interesting aspect of Sambahsa is
its naturalness, you don\'t see it as a constructed language, but as a
national language like any other. As Dave MacLeod has said in his
preface for the book *The Grammar Of Sambahsa-Mundialect In English*, "I
always imagined Sambahsa to be an example of a language that could have
existed somewhere around present-day Armenia, where a kingdom using a
descendant of Proto-Indo-European using it has been influenced over the
centuries by its Persian, Turkish and Arab neighbors, as well as various
countries from the east. At times, it feels a bit like Bulgarian, at
other times like Persian, and sometimes similar to German as well".

Sambahsa has a flag to represent it.

![](https://github.com/hmslima/sambahsacompletegrammar/blob/master/images/sambahsa_flag.png){width="8.334cm"
height="5.584cm"}

The brown color represents the ground since many Indo-European languages
derive their words for "person" from words related to clay, like the
word "earthling". The white color was chosen because it contrasts the
best. The small concentric circles represent the wheel because it is an
important innovation made by humans, the square represents the vehicle
(car, chariot...), the "T"s represent the thill, the lines represent the
axle and the bigger circle represents the Sun as well as the Circle of
Life.

The "movement" that supports Sambahsa is not linked to any kind of
thought: people from all kinds, ethnicities, places, beliefs, genders,
sexual orientations, social classes, and ideologies may use this
language as they please.

[]{#anchor-1}WHY LEARN AN AUXILIARY LANGUAGE? WE ALREADY HAVE ENGLISH
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You ask me: *"we already have English as an international language, why
learn an artificial language?"*. Before I answer this question, I must
remember that we are speaking here about a language for a world context,
if I were to work in China or, at least, stay in touch with Chinese
people, I would have to learn Mandarin, it\'s pretty obvious! The point
is: if I enter a room where there are a Pakistani, a Russian, an
American, an Argentine, and a Japanese, all of them only can have
communication if they know a common language because only a very few
people have time and disposition to learn five different languages; in
current days, it\'s expected that all these people speak English for
making possible a communication. This is the heart of the matter.

The problem with a national language -- no matter if it is English,
Spanish, French, or Mandarin -- is that it\'s too much spent time (and
also money in many cases) learning it. Of course, for those who like to
learn languages or will live in a foreign country, it\'s a **great**
investment, even learning a "less important" language is valid if it
pleases you. But when the matter is a language that serves as a bridge
between different people, the scenario is different.

I like to say that when two people communicate with each other through
the []{#anchor-2}language of a determined country, it\'s like calculate
using Roman numerals. It\'s perfectly possible to calculate with Roman
numerals, peoples did that for centuries, but it\'s much more efficient
to calculate with Hindu-Arabic numerals, which in our case would be the
communication through a language that you learn in months and is
regular. I said "language of a determined country" because people learn
-- in the international communication scope -- the English variant from
the United States of America or England, but never the English from
Jamaica and neither the one from Australia or South Africa.

### []{#anchor-3}SO ARE YOU AGAINST THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

*My* answer to this question is a loud "**NO**"(!), although some other
people may have negative views regarding the language originated in
England. English is considered as an official language in countries of
all the continents and it is relatively easy to learn, not to mention
that the United States and England are great exporters of culture. It's
because of it and other factors that many people support the idea that
English still will be used as *lingua franca* for a good amount of time,
even if the United States lose its hegemony. And personally, I think
that English is a very beautiful language.

Despite all the critiques made, English still is the most widespread
language in the globe. In practically all schools of the world with a
minimum of infrastructure, the English language is taught. It's worth
pointing out that, unlike English, no auxiliary language had the support
of States and companies to propagate it on the globe. We know that,
currently, a work will be much better exposed if it is made available in
English, which ironically includes this grammar.

[]{#anchor-4}BUT WHY LEARN SAMBAHSA? WE ALREADY HAVE ESPERANTO
--------------------------------------------------------------

Because Sambahsa presents a **different approach**, it brings something
new to the world of auxiliary languages. Esperanto is by far the most
successful auxiliary language *(for no saying "the only successful
one")*, with over 50,000 speakers at the worst estimates. To tell the
truth, the language created by the Polish Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof has no
actual competitors. Still, there are many other auxiliary languages
because there are people not satisfied with Esperanto, if you are
reading this grammar, most likely you are one of them.

Sambahsa has success in having the regularity -- and facility -- of an
auxiliary language and the naturalness and native beauty of a national
language. Sambahsa is as good as English or Portuguese for making poetry
or music. Even the imported proper nouns and names of "exotic" things
from other languages don\'t need, in most cases, to have its spelling or
pronounce drastically changed to adequate the orthography of the
language, the "difficulties" in importing these words will be the same
that occurs in any language like English or Spanish.

Regarding its vocabulary, almost half of it is based on
Proto-Indo-European, which covers a good percentage of the people of the
world, because, in addition to European languages, it also represents
speakers of Iranian languages (like Persian) and Indian ones (like
Hindi). For reasons that I will explain later, Sambahsa relies on words
from some European languages for more modern concepts, but also relies
on contributions from other languages such as Arabic and Chinese as far
as possible. It is not possible to simply collect words at random to
guarantee supposed equality, an example is that it's much more practical
to use part of the vocabulary of Greek and Latin to build technical and
scientific words. They will say that speakers of non-Indo-European
languages would be at a disadvantage, but many of these people learn an
Indo-European language at some point in their lives, so Sambahsa will
not be alien to them. Some will notice the small number of authentic
contributions from African languages, but you have to understand that
these languages had little impact on other languages outside Africa,
differently from Arabic that influenced important languages like
English, French, and Spanish.

This is a finished language, it means that you don\'t have to worry
whether what you\'ve learned today will change in five years. What you
write today in Sambahsa will be understood even in a century! I want to
make this clear because reforms will not be accepted! Sambahsa is a
unique language amid auxiliary languages, what would be the fun if this
language were one more of the same?

[]{#anchor-5}IS SAMBAHSA DIFFICULT?
-----------------------------------

Maybe you'd heard that Sambahsa is difficult. Is that true? The problem
is that people observe the language superficially and then got the wrong
idea. I am not going to be cynical in saying that this fame is
unjustified, but let's try to understand this situation.

Try to imagine the work in learning a language like Spanish or German.
Now remove all variations of this language -- in the case of the ones
spoken in different countries -- and irregularities; Sambahsa basically
is in this way. It\'s like Robert Winter said in his "Sambahsa: Guide to
Pronouns and Articles", *"Sambahsa is right on the limit of the degree
of difficulty that is practical for an international auxiliary
language"*.

**The language can be mastered in a mater of very few months** if you
have a minimum of dedication, you only have to know what are your
priorities of study and *to know how to study and what to study*!
Doesn\'t make sense decorate all declension cases from dative if you use
them a very few times! Also, you must have in mind that the fact of this
language is easy doesn't mean that you will be writing philosophical
treatises in three weeks, but maybe you can do it in four or six months.

People complain that Sambahsa has difficult sounds to learn, but all
languages have different sounds to be learned, even other auxiliary
languages that try to be the simplest. Soon after, there are a few of
the languages most studied by Americans and their sounds that don\'t
exist in the General American English *(the ones in italic are used in
Sambahsa)*.

**Spanish *****(European Castilian)***** --** \[β\], *\[x\]*, \[ɲ\],
\[ɣ\]

**German --** *\[ç\]*, *\[ʁ\]*, *\[x\]*, \[ʏ\], *\[y\]*, *\[ø\]*, \[œ\]

**French --** \[ɲ\], *\[ʁ\]*, \[ɥ\], \[œ\], *\[ø\]*, *\[y\]*, \[ɑ̃\],
\[ɛ̃\], \[œ̃\], \[ɔ̃\]

Maybe Sambahsa could have simpler sounds (simple for whom?) or less
"extra sounds", but wouldn\'t the language be poorer? The sounds are
easily learnable and I\'ll show you that you can be pronouncing all of
them in a week or less.

And look that, learning these "difficult sounds" you'll end learning the
sounds of other languages, which means that if you want to learn French
or German in the future you'll already have mastered their pronunciation
even before learning them!

I\'m still going to teach the pronunciation of words, but let me show
you right now a few words, just to you judge whether they are difficult
or not. Obviously that you will need to learn some new sounds, but you
will see that it's not rocket science. Let\'s start with the simplest
ones, which are the overwhelming majority:

There is a lot of explanation because it's not easy to explain the
pronunciation of other language using the American English orthography
(that may vary a lot!), that's why I ask for your understanding

**Aise --** ease (*pronounced "ez" where this "e" has the same sound of
the "e" from "dress")*

**Bell --** beautiful *(it's pronounced like it's written, just know
that this "e" has the same sound of the "a" from "lake", but without the
ee sound)*

**Anghen --** person *(pronounced "a‿nguen". It's not a sin if you
pronounce the Sambahsa's "a" like you do in "father", but it's better to
use the sound that you do when you speak "I", but without the ee sound)*

**Behrg --** to put out of danger *(pronounced more or less as "berg"
where this "e" has the same sound of the one from "bell")*

**Kwaun --** dog *(it's pronounced like it's written, just know that the
"au" is pronounced like "ou" from "mouth" having the Sambahsa's "a"
sound that I explained to you)*

**Rat --** rat *(again, the pronunciation of this "a" is like the "a"
from "anghen". The pronunciation of the Sambahsa's "r" admits many
forms, you can use the sound of "tt" from the American pronunciation of
"better")*

Now let\'s look at some supposed complicated words that are not even
common:

**Zowngschie --** anyway *(pronounced as "dzowng‿g‿shee" where this "ow"
has the same sound of "oa" from the American pronunciation of "goat" and
this "ng" has the same sound of the one from "thing")*

**Rjienrlwey --** mankind *(pronounced as "r‿jien‿rw‿a" where this "a"
has the same sound of the "a" from "face")*

Other complaint is that Sambahsa bases its vocabulary upon loanwords
instead of compound words, I explain: in Sambahsa, the adjective
"beautiful" is "bell" while "ugly" is "biaur". Someone could say that,
for example, an affix that inverts the meaning of the word would be
better because it would eliminate the need of memorizing hundreds of
words. Indeed, it\'s a resource that would bring some advantages, but,
on the other hand, sentences with compound sentences take a time to be
analyzed, so, after analyzing the pros and cons, it\'s more practical a
word like "biaur" than "*mal*bell"[^3]. And frankly, until you master
the grammar, you will have memorized all the most relevant words.

[]{#anchor-6}SAMBAHSA\'S VOCABULARY
-----------------------------------

Just below there is a list of languages that had contributed for
Sambahsa's vocabulary, the percentage of borrowed words and some
examples between parentheses:

**Proto-Indo-European --** 44.28 % *(skadh, paursk, potnia) *

**Latin --** 15 % *(facil, question, caise) *

**Germanic family --** 9.5 % *(apter, buk, rogv) *

**French --** 6.21 % *(journal, adresse, place) *

**Greek --** 4.64 % *(pharmacia, ieftin, papier) *

**Romance family --** 3.95 % *(important, visite, torte) *

**Arabic --** 3.42 % *(lakin, mutawassit, hatta) *

**English --** 1.45 % *(film, sport, wagon) *

**Slavic family --** 1.28 % *(lige, grance, vessel) *

**Italian --** 1 % *(autostrad, valise, dusch) *

**Indo-iranian/Persian --** 0.92 % *(naft, ris, hevd) *

**German --** 0.78 % *(dank, postamt, vurst) *

**Chinese --** 0.71 % *(gienxin, yui, saan)*

**Other languages or families --** 6.86 %

About the vocabulary that came from the reconstructed words of
Proto-Indo-European, it\'s important to say that some words can not be
guaranteed as "common Proto-Indo-European pure", Proto-Indo-European
divided into many linguistic families, but words in common among these
languages may not necessarily have their origin in Proto-Indo-European.
For example, the words "long" and "pisk" are found in the Romance
languages *("longo" and "peixe" in the case of Portuguese)* and German
languages *("long" and "fish" in the case of English)*, but it\'s
uncertain whether their origin was in Proto-Indo-European, linguistic
families continued to exchange words when Proto-Indo-European split up.

Another important detail that must be remembered is that Proto-European
was a language from the Bronze Age, so there cannot be words of things
that did not exist at that time. For example, the word "stal" ("steel"
in Sambahsa) was based on the common root of Germanic ("Stahl" in
German) and Slavic ("сталь" in Russian) languages, because there was no
steel in the Bronze Age! The word "stal" may still have some relation
with a Proto-European word, perhaps "\*stek-lo-" from "\*stak" which
means "to stand, to be firm", but that doesn\'t change the fact that
Proto-Indo-European speakers did not know steel, so they could not have
had a word for this concept.

Some words can have "multiple origins":

**Amlak --** means "asset(s)" *(finance)*, it corresponds to the Arabic
"أملاك", to the Turkish "emlak" and the Persian "املاک".

**Schut --** means "hornless", it corresponds to the Romanian "Șut", to
the Bulgarian/Serbo-croatian "šut" and to the ao Albanian "shut".

**Geong --** means "palace-fortress", it corresponds to the character
"城", which is read as *chéng* in Mandarim pinyin, *jō* in Japanese
Go-on (latinized Japanese), *seong* in Korean and *thành* in Vietnamese.

**Xiongbu --** means "chest", it corresponds to "胸部", that is
"Xiōngbù" in latinized Chinese and "kyôbu" in latinized Japonese.

**Potire --** means "pitcher", it corresponds to the Old Greek "ποτήρ",
to the Serbo-croatian "путир", to the Russian "потир" and to the
Albanian "potir".

More examples of words of languages whose contribution is not very
significant, but have their mark in Sambahsa:

**Portuguese --** banan, mingo, namor

**Spanish --** chocolat, ghitarr(a), salg, vanilia

**Baltic --** biaur, tik

**Malay --** kye *(also from slav; from Malay-Indonesian comes "ke" and
from Russian with some Slavic languages comes "k(o)") *

**Scandinavian --** leik, lyt, tiel

**Swahili --** pori, kulambu, mwembi

**Sanskrit --** bahsa, nagor

***Universal***** --** mama

**Celtic --** sapoun, brigv *(also from Germanic)*, brugs *(also from
Italian) *

**Arawak --** tabak

**Nahuatl --** tomat

Some people complain about the fact that the pronunciation of certain
words is different from the original. But this is obvious, in addition
to the fact that many of these words have multiple origins, they have
been adapted to the auxiliary language. Take "xiongbu" as an example,
which came from "胸部", the transcription of these characters for
IPA[^4], in Chinese, is \[ɕʷūŋpʷùː\] and, in Japanese, it is
\[kʲo⁠＼⁠ːbɯᵝ\]. I say it again, "xiongbu" is a word adapted to Sambahsa
and it is not based on a specific language, but two. Next point, the
Chinese language has tones and the sound \[ɕ\] that don\'t exist in
Sambahsa, in the same way that Sambahsa doesn\'t have the sound \[ɯᵝ\]
from the Japanese language. The pronunciation of the Sambahsa word
"xiongbu" is \[\'ksjoŋg.bu\], whose "x" is pronounced differently from
the one found in "Xiōngbù" and from the "k" of "kyôbu", but know the
pronunciation of the Sambahsa words is just an approximation! Even if
the word were "schiongbu", whose pronunciation would be \[\'ʃjoŋg.bu\],
it would still be intelligible to Chinese and Japanese anyway!

[]{#anchor-7}METHODOLOGY OF TEACHING
====================================

I structured the grammar in the following way: I avoid the presentation
of a new content that demands the previous knowledge of other
non-mentioned subject, for example: if for learning the future verbal
tense it\'s necessary to know the infinitive, I will teach the
infinitive before the future tense; if for learning the declension is
necessary some basic grammar knowledge, I will bring back those
teachings from middle school\'s classes. I believe that this way is the
less annoying for the beginner.

This book was made in the way that it serves the student without any
previous knowledge, in other words, I am assuming you don\'t know
another language and you even don\'t know certain basic grammar terms.
Thus, a student can read this grammar without the necessity of
consulting other books, except dictionaries. *The goal of this grammar
is to be accessible to everyone!*

**What I am going to say is important, so pay attention!** When you
study, don\'t be in a hurry for decorating all cases in the accusative
or all the list of prepositions once, take it easy (!), since you will
use some words more times than other ones. *No grammar was made to be
read just once, but many times*. Now that you are starting, read the
chapters only once, twice at most, then go on to the next chapter, *but
I admit that there will be certain matters that you'll have to master
before going on*. After finishing the reading of the grammar, start
reading texts, they will help you to increase your vocabulary and
improve your grammar knowledge since you will have to consult the
grammar for understanding how that sentence or another was made.

It can seem strange, but I started this grammar when I was at the
beginning of my studies in the language, in my second or third week of
learning, not when I already had a good mastering over Sambahsa. I had
two reasons to do that: the act of making a grammar demands great
responsibility, what boosted me in my studies, thanks to this work I
could learn things more quickly, that was a very interesting exercise;
the second reason is that the person who knows the first difficulties of
a beginner is another beginner, if I had decided to make this grammar
much time after, maybe I could forget certain difficulties that I had
and I wouldn\'t address them in this grammar.

[]{#anchor-8}YOU DON\'T NEED TO LEARN EVERYTHING
------------------------------------------------

One of the goals of this grammar is being the most complete as possible,
in other words, the goal is to cover the most basic until the elements
that will only rarely appear in the most erudite literature. There will
be things here like the optional forms of the indicative of present,
that rarely are used, but this grammar has the **obligation** of
presenting it. Focus only in what is necessary for you!

The language also has very rich phonology, some sounds doesn\'t exist in
English, but can be learned in a short time. I made the possible to
explain the sounds, since per comparisons with other languages until per
what movements of tongue and mouth are made. But if you really have
difficulty with some sounds, there is no problem, you can use a similar
sound, very improbably someone won't understand you, but endeavor a bit
for learning all sounds, it\'ll be a learning process that will serve
for other languages as you will see.

[]{#anchor-9}TIPS FOR STUDYING A LANGUAGE
-----------------------------------------

In these years studying languages I\'ve learned some things, they are
tips that are useful for any language, not only Sambahsa:

-   When you read, listen, write, or say a word, directly associate this
    word to its idea. I\'ll explain: some people, when read "nebh",
    associate this word to the English word "cloud" and then they make
    an association to a cloud. Don\'t do this, train your mind to don\'t
    need an intermediate, try to directly associate the word to the idea
    or object.

    WRONG: "kerd" → "heart" → ♥

    CORRECT: "kerd" → ♥

-   Don\'t stick to the grammar, read the grammar once or twice then go
    to the texts, you have to see the language in the practice. With
    time you will absorb the grammar rules while acquiring vocabulary.
    When, in a text, you don\'t know how certain grammatical
    construction was made, you come back to the grammar.
-   Use the language since the first day, even it is only in your mind.
    Say a "good morning" in Sambahsa, create simple sentences for daily
    situations. Try to use the language in the beginning as possible,
    even you don\'t know the most basic prepositions.

[]{#anchor-10}ALPHABET AND PRONUNCIATION
========================================

Maybe you take fright because of the size of this chapter, indeed it is
a bit big if compared to other grammars in their chapters of alphabet
and pronunciation, but it's because I need to explain everything in
depth. Ideally, I should only explain the less obvious rules and let you
take it all naturally, but since this is a complete grammar, I have the
obligation of explaining everything point by point. So, with the
exception of the SPT that we will discuss later, don\'t get too focused
on this chapter, read it only once and come back only when you don\'t
understand why a certain word was pronounced in a determined way.

The alphabet is composed by 26 Latin letters, they are: a, b, c, d, e,
f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. The
orthography is a bit complex, but still regular.

For representing the sounds of Sambahsa we have the *Sambahsa Phonetic
Transcription* (SPT), an alphabet whose words are always between curly
brackets {  } in all this grammar, the letters in UPPERCASE inside the
brackets represent the accentuated syllables and a colon (:) informs
that the vowel before this is lengthened. Be aware that the explanations
about pronunciation are based on General American English from the USA.

Initially, the SPT was made between square brackets \[  \], but I\'ve
chosen curly brackets {  } because the square brackets already are used
by the other system of phonetic transcription that I\'ll talk soon
after.

In addiction, there is something called *International Phonetic
Alphabet* (IPA), it\'s like the SPT, but IPA is used for all languages
while SPT is exclusive for Sambahsa. The letters of this alphabet will
always lie inside slashes /  / or square brackets \[  \] in this
grammar. I will use the IPA to explain the SPT, because if you have
access to the sounds of the IPA *(it\'s pretty easy to find multimedia
charts of IPA letters through the internet!)*, you\'ll have a secure
source of how the Sambahsa sounds are pronounced. **But throughout the
grammar, outside the "alphabet and pronunciation" chapter, I practically
will only use SPT! Actually, you don\'t even need to learn IPA, but it
would be a very useful resource for you.**

The difference between slashes and square brackets in IPA is the fact
that slashes indicate a more simple transcription while square brackets
indicate a more precise transcription.

Two -- /tuː/ -- \[tʰuː\]

You ask me: "why we don\'t only use IPA if this one is official and more
known while SPT only applies to Sambahsa?". There are two reasons:

-   SPT is easier to type in computers, which facilitates when someone
    wants to explain the pronunciation on the internet or in any typed
    work.
-   The most important: Sambahsa was made for people of all the world,
    one letter of SPT can encompass several sounds represented by IPA.

More observations:

-   Probably many sounds here will be new for you. Don\'t worry, all the
    sounds not found in the English language from the USA will be
    explained with all details as possible.
-   Sambahsa is very rich in what concerns sounds, if you find that some
    sound is very complicated, you can use a similar sound in its place
    if you think that the meaning of the word will neither be twisted
    and nor make confusion in the conversation. The important is that
    you use Sambahsa! 😉
-   You don\'t obligatorily need IPA, since all the sounds will be
    explained. The IPA is there just for serving as an additional
    resource for you. In fact, I try to offer as many resources as
    possible to you understand the sounds, for example: I inform that
    the SPT sound {x} is represented by the letter /ç/ in IPA, it\'s
    called "ich-laut" and I also still try to explain how to make this
    sound; if my explanation is not enough, you can still search the
    internet on how to pronounce "ich-laut", there are even videos
    teaching it.

I'll do my best to explain to you the sounds, but since even within the
USA the English language may vary, it's safer that you take a IPA chart
with sounds *(just search for it on the Internet that you'll find a lot
of useful material)* to know how they really sound like.

**{a} --** /a/ -- something like the first part of "i" in "h**i**de" or
"br**i**de", whose sound actually is \[a[]{#anchor-11}ɪ̯\],
[]{#anchor-12}[]{#anchor-13}but without the second part
\[...[]{#anchor-14}ɪ̯\], I mean, it's like when you pronounce the pronoun
"I", but without the "ee" sound. []{#anchor-15}Pay attention that {a} is
not like the "a" in "f**a**ther" or "**a**rm", whose "a" is /ɑː/. It's
like the "a" from "h**a**t" spoken by Canadians and Californians or like
in the Spanish word "**a**migo".

**{ä} --** /ɛ/ -- like "e" in "dr**e**ss" and "m**e**t" or "ea" in
"br**ea**d".

**{b} --** /b/ -- like "b" in "**b**ad".

**{c} --** /ʃ/ -- like "sh" in "**sh**oe" or "cra**sh**".

**{d} --** /d/ -- like "d" in "**d**ay".

**{e} --** /e/ -- something like the first part of "a" in "l**a**ke",
whose sound actually is /eɪ̯/, but without the sound /...ɪ̯/. It\'s like
the "e" in the Spanish word "gu**e**rrilla", the "é" in the French word
"beaut**é**" or the "ee" in the standard German "S**ee**le". Think in
the "ay" from the word "m**ay**" spoken by an American.

**{ë} --** /ə/ -- like "a" in "comm**a**", "**a**gain" or "u" in
"syr**u**p".

**{f} --** /f/ -- like "f" in "**f**ather".

**{g} --** /g/ -- like "g" in "**g**irl" or "**g**oat".

**{h} --** /h/ -- like "h" in "**h**orse"

**{i} --** /i/ -- like "ee" in "m**ee**t", "y" in "happ**y**", "ey" in
"mon**ey**" or "ie" in "part**ie**s".

**{j} --** /[]{#anchor-16}ʒ/ -- like "s" "vi**s**ion" or "a**s**ian" or
"g" in "bei**g**e"

**{k} --** /k/ -- like "c" in "**c**ut", "ck" in "ba**ck**" or "k" in
"spea**k**"

**{l} --** /l/ -- like "l" in "**l**eft" or "sou**l**".

**{m} --** /m/ -- like "m" in "**m**other".

**{n} --** /n/ -- like "n" in "**n**ight"

**{o} --** /o/ or /ɔ/ -- the /o/ sound is something like the fist part
of "o" in "g**o**", whose sound actually is /o[]{#anchor-17}ʊ̯/, but
without the semivowel /...ʊ̯/. It\'s like the "o" in the Spanish
"h**o**la", the "eau" in the French word "rés**eau**" or the "o" in the
standard German word "**o**der". The /ɔ/ sound is usually found in "o"
of "n**o**rth".

In order to you understand the flexibility of Sambahsa, look below the
possible pronunciations of the Sambahsa adjective "composite":

\[kom.po\'zit\]

\[kɔm.pɔ\'zit\]

\[kom.pɔ\'zit\]

\[kɔm.po\'zit\]

**{ö} --** /ø/ -- like the "ö" from German or the "eux" French. It\'s
like when you make the {e} sound, but with the mouth in the form when
you make the {o} sound, in other words, speak {e} with the lips
puckered.

**{p} --** /p/ -- like "p" in "**p**each".

**{q} --** /x/ -- like the "j" in the Spanish word "**j**ota", the
German "ach-laut" or like "ch" in the Scots word "lo**ch**". It\'s like
the {h} sound, but you put the back of your tongue against your soft
palate as you do with {k} and {g}; think in a vintage kettle.

**{r} --** in situations like in "**r**adh", "p**r**ete" and
"accu**r**at", where after "r" there is a vowel, you can pronounce it as
the "tt" in the American pronunciation of "be**tt**er" /ɾ/. Actually,
Sambahsa admits a wide variety of sounds, but *if* it's for elect an
official sound, it should be the uvular "r" (/ʀ/) from German.
[]{#anchor-18}Don\'t you know German? []{#anchor-19}There is no problem
*(even though you aren\'t obliged to learn this sound!!!)*, here\'s how
to make this sound. Do the following exercise, gargle a bit of water
*(or any other liquid)* in order to you understand how to vibrate your
uvula. The /[]{#anchor-20}ʀ/ sound is made by the trill of the uvula.

**{r} --** /[]{#anchor-21}ʁ/ -- in situations like in "i**r**k" and
"amo**r**", where just after "r" there is a consonant, or this "r" is
the last letter of the word, this consonant assumes the sound \[ʁ\]. The
/ʁ/ is very similar the sound {h}, but there are two differences: you
must vibrate your vocal cords and the place of articulation of
/[]{#anchor-22}ʁ/ is the uvula -- while the place of articulation of
/⁠h/ is the glottis *(which for some people is the same that it doesn\'t
have a place of articulation)* --, in other words, you must put the back
of your tongue against the uvula. If it still is difficult for you,
let\'s try an exercise: when you make the sound /h/ you don\'t vibrate
your vocal cords, the vibration of the vocal cords are important, it\'s
that what differentiates the sounds /t/ *(voiceless, without vibration)*
and /d/ *(voiced, with vibration)*, /k/ (voiceless) and /g/ *(voiced)*,
/s/ *(voiceless)* and /z/ *(voiced)*, /f/ *(voiceless)* and /v/
*(voiced)*; OK, try to make the sound /h/ be voiced, in order to make
the sound /ɦ/ *(/ɦ/ is just the voiced version of /h/ if you didn\'t
understand)*; when you be able to make the sound /ɦ/, then make this
sound with the back of the tongue against the uvula, thus you will be
making the sound /ʁ/. Just below some examples in IPA:

spar -- /spaʁ/

cherkin -- /t͡ʃəʁ\'kin/

wir -- /wiʁ/

clever -- /\'klevəʁ/

cort -- /koʁt/

amor -- /a\'moʁ/

aur -- /\'aʊʁ/

mer -- /meʁ/

air -- /ɛʁ/

atelier -- /atə\'ljeʁ/

ier -- /jeʁ/

ierk -- /jeʁk/

piurn -- /pjuʁn/

oyr -- /ojʁ/

ayr -- /ajʁ/

butour -- /bu\'tuːʁ/

alabster -- /a\'labstəʁ/

gurgule -- /\'guʁgyl/

eurp -- /øʁp/

arbust -- /aʁ\'bust/

ender -- /\'endəʁ/

biaur -- /bj\'aʊʁ/

An alternative to /ʁ/, in this case, is /ʀ/. In other words, you also
may pronounce the words "spar" and "cort" as \[spaʀ\] and \[koʀt\].

**{s} **-- /s/ -- like "s" in "**s**ound" or "c" in "ri**c**e".

**{t} --** /t/ -- like "t" in "**t**o**t**al".

**{u} --** /u/ -- like "oo" in "l**oo**se".

**{ü} --** /y/ -- like the French "u" or the German "ü". It\'s very
simple, just speak {i} with the lips puckered

**{v} **-- /v/ -- like "v" in "**v**ein"

**{w} --** /w/ -- like "w" in "**w**ater"

**{y} --** /j/ -- like "y" in "**y**ou"

**{x} --** /ç/ -- like the German "ich-laut" *(maybe it\'s like the "h"
in "**h**uman" or "**h**uge" depending on the variant)*. Put the back of
your tongue against your hard palate, then you try to pronounce this
sound as you would do with {s}, but without using the teeth.

**{z} --** /z/ -- like "z" in "**z**ap".

**{§} --** /θ/ -- like "th" in "bir**th**day" or "**th**in", but *not*
like in "**th**is" whose sound is /ð/.

**{tc} --** /[]{#anchor-23}t͡ʃ/ -- like "ch" in "whi**ch**" or
"**ch**eap"

**{dj} --** /[]{#anchor-24}d͡ʒ/ -- like "g" in "hu**g**e" or "j" in
"**j**ump"

**{ng} --** /[]{#anchor-25}ŋg/ -- for those who don't know IPA, the
sound /ŋ/ is the same of "ng" from words like "thi**ng**" or "ki**ng**",
but observe that when you speak a Sambahsa word like "cing", you still
make the "g" sound.

**{nk} --** /ŋk/

I suggest you learn the SPT very well before move on. Because it\'s a
very important part, I suggest you make an exception and read this
chapter more than twice, I need that you know it very well.

[]{#anchor-26}SOME ENGLISH WORDS IN IPA AND SPT
-----------------------------------------------

If you\'ve reached here without understanding very well both alphabets,
let\'s see whether with the list below you understand them. Deliberately
I\'ve inserted some words whose sounds don't exist in Sambahsa, I did it
to make you pay attention to the differences between the two languages,
in these cases there won't a transcription to SPT.

It\'s important to highlight that the SPT was not made to transcribe
words of other languages that are not Sambahsa (!!!), what we\'re going
to do here is just fun for you acquiring more intimacy with the SPT.

Firstly I show the word, then the transcription to IPA and then the
transcription in SPT.

[]{#anchor-27}A LAST VISIT TO THE ALPHABET AND THE NAME OF THE LANGUAGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you already know SPT, let\'s go back to the alphabet for you
know how each letter is pronounced:

a {a}, b {be}, c {tse}, d {de}, e {e}, f {ef}, g {dje}, h {hatc}, i {i},
j {jye}, k {ka}, l {el}, m {em}, n {en}, o {o}, p {pe}, q {ku}, r {er},
s {es}, t {te}, u {u}, v {ve}, w {we}, x {iks}, y {ü}, z {dzed}

Before we go on, it\'s important to know how our language is pronounced!

**Sambahsa Mundialect --** {sambA:sa mundyAlëkt}

[]{#anchor-28}WE ARE NOT FINISHED YET, SOME CONVENTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

**Before we go on, a warning: **don\'t worry with the more complex
pronunciation rules, because I\'ll show you the pronunciation of each
example in almost all parts of this grammar, so you\'ll naturally learn
the pronunciation. *Don\'t memorize anything, understand it, absorb it
naturally*! My advice is: read this part once or twice -- at most --
then go on with your studies. Is the orthography too difficult? No, but
it can be boring at the beginning for those who are starting and it is
not, in my personal opinion, obligatory at the beginning since I\'ll
dispose of the pronunciation with the examples.

The vowels are represented by V, they are: "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". The
consonants and semivowels are represented by C. The letters "w" and "y"
are usually semi-vowels, but they can have the role of vowels in certain
circumstances, as well as the letters "i" and "u" can have the role of
semi-vowels. For example:

**mercat --** CVCCVC

**ayasch --** VCVCCC

**materia --** CVCVCCV

**dedwrnt --** CVCVCCC

**rally --** CVCCV

### []{#anchor-29}THE LETTER "e":

When it is the stressed []{#anchor-30}syllable or the first letter of
the word, it\'s pronounced as {e}.

**dec {dek} --** ten

**incandescent {inkandEsënt} --** incandescent

**emigrant {emigrAnt} --** emigrant

It\'s not pronounced when alone in the final of a word...

**monte {mont} --** mount *(an animal)*

**claviature {klavyatÜr} --** keyboard

[]{#anchor-31}**clientele {klyentEl} -- **customers

Naturally, this rule does not apply if this "e" is the only vowel in the
word

**ste {ste} --** (you) are *(conjugation of the verb "to be" in the
second person plural)*

**me {me} --** me

... or at the end of a word before the letters "s" and "t".

**crimes {krims} --** crimes

**accuset {akÜzt} --** (he/she) accuses

In some cases, the loss of "e" can create confusion or make the word
unpronounceable, in such situations "e" assumes the sound {ë}.

**resignet {rëzInyët} --** resigned

**mecanismes {mëkanIsmës} --** mechanisms

All words ending with "quet" and "ques" are pronounced, respectively, as
{kët} e {kës}.

**jaquet {jAkët} --** jacket

**boutiques {bu:tIkës} --** stores, shops

In all the other cases "e" has the {ë} sound, like in "kohlen", which is
pronounced as {kO:lën}.

### []{#anchor-32}THE LETTER "h":

The {h} sound appears when "h" is at the beginning of a word or between
vowels.

**habe {hab} --** have

**hellen {hElën} --** Greek

**alcohol {alkohOl} --** alcohol

[]{#anchor-33}When the letter "h" is after a vowel and it is not
followed by another vowel, the letter "h" serves to indicate that the
pronunciation of the vowel must be lengthened.

[]{#anchor-34}**kohlen {kO:lën} --** hiden

**bahsa {bA:sa} --** language

**bah {ba:} --** to say, to speak

**hehlp {he:lp} --** help

*Maybe you ask me: "don\'t would be much more simple to write the vowel
twice to indicate the bigger duration of its pronounce? Instead of
writing 'bahsa', wouldn't be simpler to write 'baasa'?"*

**The answer is:** No! This would produce a different sound, "baasa"
would be pronounced as {baAza}

If the letter "h" is after a diphthong, like in "credeih", which means
"to believe", you lengthen the pronunciation of the main vowel then you
release the semivowel.

**eih {e:y} --** to go

**addeih {adE:y} --** to add

**wehrgeih {we:rdjE:y} --** to play, to run

"gh", "bh" e "dh" respectively correspond to {g}, {b} and {d}, the "h"
in these letters serves to indicate that they will not suffer any kind
of modification.

**portughesche {portugEc} --** Portuguese

**raubher {rAobër} --** robber

**aurdhen {Aordën} --** order

similar, in practice the "e", in this case, normally ends being
absorbed, in other words, it is not pronounced. In this case, any final
consonant -- except "s" -- shifts the stress on "a", and leads to that
pronunciation different from "wakea".*

**"j" {j} --** like in "jins" {jins} *(jeans)*

**"r" {r} --** as there are people from different backgrounds, *it\'s
admitted a wide variety of manners of how this sound is made, including
our "r" from "red" or "tt" from the American pronunciation of "better"
*! The recommended form -- but it\'s not compulsory -- it\'s the way
spoken in Luxembourg or Saarland, /ʀ/. However, this sound can take
other forms:

**"rr" /r(r)/ and "rh" /r(h)/ --** it's recommended the pronunciation of
the Spanish "rr" (/r/). It\'s made by the trill of the tongue in the
alveolar ridge, but know that the movement of the tongue is more made by
the airflow than the tongue itself. It\'s like the /ɾ/ of "be**tt**er",
but you have multiple vibrations of the tongue instead of a single
vibration of /ɾ/.

**"rl" --** it's recommended the pronunciation of the Japanese "r"
(/ɺ/), it may also be pronounced as /rl/ or /ʁl/. Observe to where goes
the tip of your tongue when you say the consonants "d" and "l", talk "da
la da la da la..." at least a ten times, notice that the tip of your
tongue touches two different spots of the superior part of your mouth
cavity, in the pronunciation of "d" the tip of your tongue is closer to
the teeth while the one of "l" is farther, in a way that there is a
space between these two spots; well, the pronunciation of the Japanese
"r" is made with the tongue's tip touching this space between. Here is
the other tip, it\'s very similar to the /ɾ/ of "be**tt**er", but you
must hold your tongue during a tiny bit of time in order to the air pass
at the laterals of your tongue instead of the center of the tongue.

In hte case of "rl" being preceded by a vowel, the pronunciation will be
/ʁl/:

*"churli" (slander, blackbiting):* \[t͡ʃuʁlɪ\]

*"feurl" (furl):* \[føʁl\]

*"Carl":* \[kaʁl\]

I want to reiterate, there are multiple manners of pronouncing "r",
let's see some examples:

*"robot" (robot):* \[ʀo\'bot\] / \[ro\'bot\] / \[ɾo\'bot\]

*"rjienrlwey" (humankind):* \[ʀ.ʒjen\'ɺweɪ̯\] / \[r.ʒjen\'ɺweɪ̯\] /
\[ɾ.ʒjen\'ɺweɪ̯\] / \[ɾ.ʒjen\'ɾweɪ̯\]

I didn't include \[ʀ.ʒjen\'ʀweɪ̯\] and \[r.ʒjen\'rweɪ̯\] because they
don't indicate the difference between "r" and "rl".

**"s" {s} --** like in "sofa" {sOfa} *(sofa)*

**"s" {z} *****(****when between vowels****)***** --** like in "firasat"
{firazAt} *(face, general outlook)*

**"x" {ks} -- /ks/ --** like in "xiongbu" {ksyOngbu} *(chest)*

{ks} may become {gz} if it facilitates the pronunciation for you.

**"z" {dz} --** /d͡z/ -- like in "[]{#anchor-42}zoo" {dzOo} *(zoo)*

[]{#anchor-43}MORE REMARKS
--------------------------

Some letters, especially those at the end of the word, may be modified
by the neighbor sounds. Like in the case of "hands" {handz} *(hands)*.

Some consonants, as well as the vowel {ë}, may be omitted. The word
"franceois" officially is {frantsëOys}, but it may be {fransOys} because
of {t} is inside a consonant cluster and the unstressed vowel {ë} is
close to the stressed vowel {o}.

If the verbal form starts with {s*C*}, oi- may be added before this word
for euphonic reasons. For example "skap", which becomes "oiskap".

[]{#anchor-58}IF YOU FOUND SOME SOUNDS VERY DIFFICULT
-----------------------------------------------------

I did my best to teach you each sound, but if you really can\'t learn
some of them -- but I believe you can -- it\'s not the end of the
world!!! If you can\'t pronounce sounds like /⁠x/ or /ç/, no-one you put
you in jail if you use /ʃ/ and /h/ in their places. If you can\'t
pronounce the Japanese "r", use our "r". The good news is that the
difficult sounds are rarely used, with the exception of the vowels not
found in the English language.

The advantage of learning the phonetics of Sambahsa is that you master
the phonetics of many other languages.

[]{#anchor-59}SELLAMAT!
=======================

Sellamat! It\'s with this word, "sellamat" {selamAt}, that we say
"hello", you also may say "salut" {salUt}, which has the same function.

In this chapter I\'ll show you some sentences, maybe you\'ll deduce the
elements of each one by yourself, but, anyway, in posterior chapters
I\'ll unravel each sentence\'s element, so don\'t worry if you don\'t
understand something in this chapter.

Different from English and most of the auxiliary languages, the Sambahsa
verbs are conjugated. All verbs are regular, except the verbs for "to
be", "to have" and "to know", but they are not difficult. Let\'s start
with some basic sentences:

**Som **[]{#anchor-60}[]{#anchor-61}**John {som **[]{#anchor-62}**djOn}
--** ([]{#anchor-63}I) am John

**Io som **[]{#anchor-64}**John {yo som djOn}***** *****--**
[]{#anchor-65}I am John

**Ego som **[]{#anchor-66}**John {Ego som djOn}***** *****--** I am John
*(more emphasis at "I")*

Notice that, in the same way as occurs in Spanish, in most cases, you
may omit the pronoun because the own verb indicates the used pronoun.
You\'ve just met the verb correspondent to "to be" when linked to the
pronoun "I". Let\'s go to the next sentences:

**Es **[]{#anchor-67}**Robert {es **[]{#anchor-68}**rObërt } --**
Y[]{#anchor-69}ou are Robert

**Es **[]{#anchor-70}**Linda {es **[]{#anchor-71}**lInda} --**
Y[]{#anchor-72}ou are Linda

**Tu es **[]{#anchor-73}**Robert {tu es **[]{#anchor-74}**rObërt } --**
Y[]{#anchor-75}ou are Robert

**Tu es Linda {tu es lInda} --** You are Linda

**Is est Robert {is est rObërt} --** He is Robert

**Ia est Linda {ya est lInda} --** She is Linda

[]{#anchor-76}**Smos **[]{#anchor-77}**Americans {smos
**[]{#anchor-78}**amërikAns} --** W[]{#anchor-79}e are Americans

**Wey smos Americans {wey smos amërikAns} --** We are Americans

**Sambahsa est facil {sambA:sa est fAtsil} --** Sambahsa is easy

The next cases are fairly interesting:

**Id est gohd {id est go:d} --** It is good *(neutral)*

**El est gohd {el est go:d} --** He/She is good *(undetermined)*

**UNDERSTAND IT VERY WELL:** neutral pronouns refer to things,
undetermined pronouns are used when it\'s not known the gender or it\'s
not desired to say the gender. **Pay attention:** from now, all pronouns
or articles that I *don\'t* indicate as *neutral* or *undetermined*,
will have either the masculine gender or the feminine gender, but I can
specify whether the word is related to a male or female being if it\'s
really necessary when the word itself can\'t inform to which gender it
is related. Are we understood?

To make clear what is *neutral* and what is *undetermined*, look the
examples below:

**Chair -- **to the best of my knowledge, chairs don\'t have gender, so
it is *neutral*

**Dog --** if we don\'t know its gender, so it is *undetermined*

**Bitch *****(f****emale dog****)***** --** feminine

**Grandfather --** masculine

**Tree --** even it is a living creature, it has no gender *(although
you can argue about dioecious plants...)*, so it\'s *neutral*

**Daughter --** feminine

**Child --** as the gender is not specified, it\'s *undetermined*

**Ectoplasm -- *****like in "the ectoplasm was exteriorized by the
medium"***** --** it\'s *neutral*, because "ectoplasm" here is
considered as a substance

**Ectoplasm -- *****like in "the ectoplasm spoke to me"***** --** it can
be *masculine*, *feminine* or *undetermined*

**Android --** you decide, it depends on the context and point of view
of each one, it can be *neutral*, *undetermined*, or even have a gender.

In case of doubt whether the word must be considered as *neutral* or
*undetermined*, use the undetermined* *form.

We\'ve known the basic pronouns and their verbs, now let\'s see more
pronouns and verbs in the plural:

**Smos prients {smos pryents} --** (W[]{#anchor-80}e) are friends

**Wey smos prients {wey smos pryents} --** We are friends

**Ste prients {ste pryents} --** Y[]{#anchor-81}ou are friends

**Yu ste prients {yu ste pryents} --** You are friends

[]{#anchor-82}[]{#anchor-83}**Yu ste prient {yu ste pryent} --** You are
friend *(notice that this one is in the singular)*

**Tu es prient {tu es pryent} --** You are friend *(equal to the
sentence just above, but this is informal)*

**Ies sont prients {yes sont pryents} --**
T[]{#anchor-84}[]{#anchor-85}hey are friends *(all of the masculine
gender)*

**Ias sont prients {yas sont pryents} --**
T[]{#anchor-86}[]{#anchor-87}hey are friends *(all of the feminine
gender)*

**I sont prients {i sont pryents} -- **They are friends *(undetermined)*

**Ia sont gohd {ya sont go:d} --** They are good *(neutral)*

I believe I don\'t need to explain any of these sentences, I only have
to say that when "yu" is used in the singular, it is for formal
situations, with people you have no intimacy, therefore a courtesy
pronoun, and you use "tu" with close friends, family, and kids.

Notice that, even in the singular, the pronoun "yu" make use of the verb
"ste". Only the context can inform whether the "yu" is in singular or
plural.

Another important observation about the second person of plural "yu".
You already know that, in most cases, the use of the pronoun is not
necessary, but in future examples, you\'ll notice that the pronunciation
of the third-person singular and the second-person plural are identical,
look:

**Is lieubht me {is liÖb*****t***** me} --** He loves me

**Yu lieubhte me {yu liÖb*****t***** me} --** You love me

That is why, in the conjugation of the second-person plural, the use of
the pronoun "yu" is mandatory.

You must know how to say the phrase "there be", in the sense of
existence. It is pretty similar to English, I\'ll use the noun "anghen"
{Angën}, which means "person", and the adverb "her" {her}, which means
"here", in the following examples:

**Sont anghens her {sont Angëns her} --** T[]{#anchor-88}here are
persons here

**Ter sont anghens her {ter sont Angëns her} --** There are persons here

You may use or not the "ter".

[]{#anchor-89}USEFUL WORDS AND SENTENCES

hol} --** I haven't understood everything *(what you wanted to say)*

[]{#anchor-97}THE DECLENSION CASES
==================================

Sambahsa has an interesting characteristic, it has a system of
declension cases that are: *nominative*, *accusative*, *dative*, and
g*enitive*. These cases refer to pronouns and articles. But what they
are and how they are used?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Observe the sentence below:                                           |
|                                                                       |
| **The man buys the car:** In this case, "the man" is the one who is   |
| *doing* the action, which in this case is the buying; and "the car"   |
| is the one that is *directly* *suffering* (or *directly* *being       |
| benefited*) by the action. "the man" is in the position of nominative |
| while "the car" in the position of accusative.                        |
|                                                                       |
| **I eat a tomato --** "I" (position of []{#anchor-98}nominative), "a  |

| **People walk on the streets --** "people" (position of               |

  To {to}                                                          to               ad to            os to

  ---------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------- ---------------- --------------

Please see the subchapter "How work generic pronouns like "to" and
"quo"?" from the chapter "Common mistakes and questions".

The pronoun "ego" is the emphasized form of "io". When we use "ego"
instead "io", we want to say that there is a certain relevance in the
"I".

Let\'s see some simple examples with the nominative and accusative
cases:

**Is kamt iam --** He likes her

**Ia kamt iom --** She likes him

Regarding the dative case, pay attention that if there is a preposition,
you will use a word from the accusative case. Let\'s look at two
possible translations of the sentence "He left the house for her" where
"left" is translated as "likwit" and "the house" is translated as "id
dom".

Is likwit ay id dom

Is likwit id dom pro iam

What differentiates the two phrases above -- which have the very same
meaning -- is the way how "for her" was translated. In the first
sentence, I only used the dative case "ay". In the second one, I used
the preposition "pro" (which is the translation of "for"), so I could
only use the word in the accusative case, which in the case was "iam",
although "pro iam" is in the dative position.

By the way, if you forget the dative form, you can use the preposition
"ad":

**mi =** ad me

**tib =** ad te

**tal =** ad tel

quei = ad quod

Let\'s talk about the genitive case now. Let\'s see some examples

**Id apel ios dru {id Apël yos dru} --** The apple of the tree.

**Id hand al person {id hand al përsOn} --** The hand of the person

**Id augos cios wir -- {id Aogos tsyos wir}** **--** The power of that
man

**Ia quitances tos munt {ya kitAntsës tos munt} --** The bills of this
month

You ask me: *may I, for example, substitute "ios" for "os is", "ias" for
"as ia", "tal" for "os tel", "quos" for "os quod" and so on?* It\'s
preferable that you don\'t do that.

  ------------ --------- ----------- -------------- ----------

[]{#anchor-110}EXPLANATION
--------------------------

Sometimes their use is compulsory, as in the words "vasyo" (everything)
and "alyo" (another):

**Vasyas gwens --** all the women

**Alyo wir --** another man

**Vasyi paters --** all the fathers

**Alyo stul --** another chair

**Alya stuls --** some other chairs

"Vasy-" only exists in the plural.

Remember that, also, there is the genitive case, which represents
possession.

**Henrique\'s book --** Henriques buk

**Matheus\' house --** Matheus*io*s dom *(notice that I\'ve used the
complete termination because "Matheus" already finishes with "s")*

**Woman\'s son --** gwens son

**America\'s beauty --** Americas beauteit

For euphonic effects or literary proposals, like poetry, you can use
these declensions in other words like, for example, the indefinite
article "un", but these declensions often only are applied to the words
"vasyo" and "alyo". Remember however that those "euphonic" declensions
can be used only if they are compatible with the accentuation of the
word.

The sentence "un bell dom" {un bel dom}, may be written as "uno bello
dom" {Uno bElo dom}.

The plural of "bell plaj" may be written as "bella plaja".

An example where the declination would be incompatible: the
pronunciation of the word "dugter", which means "daughter", is {dUgtër}.
If I write "dugtera", the pronunciation is distorted for {dugtEra},
therefore is wrong to write "dugtera".

A more practical example where the use of the declination is useful to
help in the pronunciation:

**I edde omo miems --** They eat raw meat

I could say "i edde om miems", but this cluster of the m's in
"...om‿miems" can be a bit uncomfortable to pronounce for some people
and/or it can be understood as "omiems".

Complementing what was said, the declensions are optional for many
classes of words.

With declination:

I auyi lieubhe ir napters

The grandparents love their grandsons

I napters lieubhe ir auyens

The grandsons love their grandparents

Nihsim mien auyo ed mien auyu do id hospital

I took my grandfather and my grandmother to the hospital

I medyi sakerdots hehlpent id popule, it id popule lieubht i medyens
sakerdots

The middle-priests help the people, so the people love the
middle-priests

Without declination (they're correct too):

I auyi lieubhe ir napters

I napters lieubhe ir auyi

Nihsim mien auyo ed mien auya do id hospital

I medyo sakerdots hehlpent id popule, it id popule lieubht i medyo
sakerdots

[]{#anchor-111}THE ARTICLES
===========================

[]{#anchor-112}DEFINITE ARTICLES
--------------------------------

A characteristic of Sambahsa that stands out is its definite articles,
the words are the same as the pronouns. How? Look the translations
below:

**The man --** is wir {is wir}

**The woman --** ia gwen {ya gwen}

**The dog --** el kwaun {el kwAon}

**The person --** el anghen {el Angën} *or* el person {el përsOn}

**The person --** is anghen *(masculine person)*

**The country --** id land {id land}

**The folk -- **id folk {id folk}

Can you understand how the language works? In the logic of Sambahsa, you
don\'t speak "the secretary" or "the man", but "she secretary" and "he
man". Bear in mind that the articles suffer the declension as well as
the pronouns.

***The***** dog loves *****the***** woman -- ***el* kwaun lieubht *iam*
gwen {el kwAon liöbt yam gwen}

You could not translate "The dog loves the woman" as "el kwaun lieubht
*ia* gwen" because the definite article that is linked to the
substantive "woman" must suffer the declension to accusative.

Another example, but involving the dative case too:

***The***** *****(female)***** manager sent *****the***** e-mail
*****for the***** *****(male)***** president --** *ia* manager yisit
*id* blixbrev *ei* president

[]{#anchor-113}INDEFINITE ARTICLE
---------------------------------

The indefinite article is "un".

**An apple --** un apel {un Apël}

**A wall --** un mur {un mur}

**A boy --** un pwarn {un pwarn}

**A girl --** un bent {un bent}

The Sambahsa word "sem" is not an indefinite article, but I'll explain
about it now. It's like our "some", same as in English it doesn't change
its number when the substantive is in the plural, look:

**Sem apel {sem Apël} --** some apple

**Sem apels {sem Apëls} --** some apples

But if this "sem" is as a substantive, thus it must receive an
appropriate ending. Just after there is a complex sentence. Of course,
you don't need to understand it now, I only want you to see how this
"sem" can behave as a substantive.

**Sems credeihnt est neid global warmen --** some (people) believe there
is no global warming

[]{#anchor-114}HOW TO SAY THE CONJUNCTIONS "AND" AND "OR"
=========================================================

I know that it's still early for the conjunctions, but allow me to
introduce you to these two basic ones, because until we reach the
chapter about conjunctions, maybe we will have seen some examples with
them.

The conjunction "and" is translated as "ed" for Sambahsa.

**He and I -- **is ed io {is ed yo}

With "or" you need to pay a bit more attention. Often you\'ll use "au":

**He or me -- **is au io {is Ao yo}

But when we deal with two clauses, we use the conjunction "we" *(don\'t
get confused with the English pronoun!)*. I\'ll use a complex sentence,
but only look at how the conjunction is used:

[]{#anchor-115}My child, you must choose: to play in the park *or* to
swim in the pool

Mien purt, dehlcs chuses: likes in id park *we* snahe in id piscine

[]{#anchor-116}**POSSESSION** 
==============================

Here are the prepositions of possession:

**Masculine in the singular --** os

**Masculine in the plural --** om

**Feminine in the singular --** as

**Feminine in the plural --** am

**Neutral in the singular --** os

**Neutral in the plural --** om

[]{#anchor-117}**Undetermined in the singular --** es

**Undetermined in the plural --** em

Look at some examples:

**The sister of Louis --** ia swester os Louis {ya swEstër os lU:is}

**The house of Paul and Peter --** id dom om Paul ed Peter {id dom om
pAol ed pEtër}

**The son of Julia --** is son as Julia {is son as jUlya}

**The doll of Lara and Carla --** id pupp am Lara ed Carla {id pup am
lAra ed kArla}

When diverse elements are owners of something, you also may use the word
"sbei" {sbey}, thus "id dom om Paul ed Peter" and "id pupp am Lara ed
Carla" may be rewritten as:

"Paul ed Peter sbei dom"

"Lara ed Carla sbei pupp"

Another possibility is the use of declensions if the word allows it:

**Max\'s sister --** Maxios swester {mAksyos swEstër}

**The husband of Emma --** Emmas mann {Emas man}

**Paul and Peter\'s house --** Paul(io)s ed Peters dom {id pAol(yo)s ed
pEtërs dom}

We could not say "Peter*io*s" because this manner would change the
accentuation of the word, thus would be {petEryos}.

*You don't need a definite article like "ia Maxios swester" or "id
Paulos ed Peters dom" because the substantives already are 'defined' by
the genitive.*

[]{#anchor-118}DIFFERENCE OF USE OF PREPOSITION OF POSSESSION AND GENITIVE CASE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ios --** of the

**Os --** of

**Ias --** of the

**As --** of

**Tos --** of that

Notice that, in the translations of the genitive case, we use the
definite article "the" with the preposition "of", while the preposition
of possession is only translated to a preposition. I\'ll show you some
inappropriate sentences for you to understand:

"Ia swester ios Louis" would be translated to "the sister of the Louis"
and "Id apel os dru" would be translated to "the apple of tree". Do you
understand now?

[]{#anchor-119}OTHER PREPOSITIONS OF POSSESSION
-----------------------------------------------

**Mien {myen} --** my, mine

**Tien {tyen} --** your, yours *(singular)*

**Eys {eys} --** his

**Ays {ays} --** her, hers

**Ids {Idz} --** its *(neutral)*

**Els {elz} --** his / her *(also "hers")* *(undetermined)*

**Ir {ir} --** their, theirs *(masculine, feminine, neutral and
undetermined)*

**Sien {syen} --** his, her, its, their, hers, theirs. *Used when it
refers to the subject of the sentence.*

**Uns {uns} --** of a(n)

**My house --** mien dom {myen dom}

**His city--** eys urb {eys urb}

**Our world --** nies mund {nyes mund} / noster mund {nOstër mund}

**Your land --** vies land {vyes land} / voster land {vOstër land}

"*Nies" and "noster", as well as "vies" and "voster", means the same
thing.*

I\'ll teach you how to use the pronoun "sien" after I teach you the
verbs".

We may combine these pronouns with the declensions:

**... of my men --** ... mienen wirs {miEnën wirs}

**... of your son --** ... tien(io)s son {tiEn(yo)s son}

**... of our daughters --** ... niesen dugters {nyEzën dUgtërs}

**... of our daughter --** ... niesias dugter {nyEzyas dUgtër}

**... of your**^**(plur.)**^** grandsons --** ... viesen napters {vyEzën
nAptërs}

**... of your**^**(plur.)**^** grandsons --** ... viesios napter
{vyEzyos nAptër}

**Example:** the house of your son → id dom tiens son

Of course that you may say something like "id dom os tien son" or "id
pupp am nies dugters".

You ask me, "Could I write something like 'nosterios' or 'vosteren'"?
No, because it would change the pronunciation of the original words, it
is preferable that you use "nies" and "vies" instead of "noster" and
"voster", but if you still want to apply the declension in those last
two words, you could write them in the following ways:

... nostern dugters {nOstërn dUgtërs}

... nostren dugters {nOstrën dUgtërs}

... nostrias dugter {nOstryas dUgtër}

... vostern napters {vOstërn nAptërs}

... vostren napters {vOstrën nAptërs}

... vostrios napter {vOstryos nAptër}

[]{#anchor-121}NAMES OF PLACES WITH CATEGORY
============================================

When we talk about names of places that include their category, like
"City of Prescott" or "Mount Everest", normally we decide the position
of the category names through the use of the national languages, for
example:

**City of Prescott --** citad Prescott

**Mount Everest --** Mont Everest

**Rock of Gibraltar --** Perwnt Gibraltar

**Casterly Rock --** Casterly Rock

**Liancourt Rocks --** Perwnts ios Liancourt *(this is interesting
because, although its original names are "Dokdo" and "Takeshima", in the
West it has a different name. Since the name comes from French ("Rochers
Liancourt", due to the French whaling ship that sank in that region in
1849), we say "Perwnts ios Liancourt" instead of "Liancourt Rocks")*

See the examples below:

**Lieubho brigvs, in mien safers ho kohgnet maung brigvs: Brigv JK,
Millennium Brigv, Brigv Alexandre III, Charles/Karluv Brigv, Kintai
Brigv ed Brigv os Rialto --** I love bridges, in my travels, I\'ve known
many bridges: JK Bridge, Millennium Bridge, Pont Alexandre III, Charles
Bridge, Kintai Bridge and Rialto Bridge.

**Brigv JK =** Ponte Juscelino Kubitschek

**Millennium Brigv =** Millennium Bridge

**Brigv Alexandre III =** Pont Alexandre-III

**Charles/Karluv Brigv =** Karlův most

**Kintai Brigv =** 錦帯橋 Kintai-kyō

**Brigv os Rialto =** Ponte di Rialto

In Sambahsa we don\'t use the genitive when the name refers to the whole
place because it would be appellation, we don\'t say "id citad os
Montréal" but "id citad Montréal", but we have to say "id tribunal os
Montréal" because Montreal is not a tribunal. Another example is the
translation of "Palace of Versailles" *("Château de Versailles" in the
original)*, which is "Chateau os Versailles" in Sambahsa.

[]{#anchor-122}ADJECTIVES
=========================

An adjective is a word that qualifies a noun, as in "the beautiful
house", where the adjective "beautiful" qualifies the noun "house".

The construction of adjectives is similar to English, you have to put
the adjective just before the noun. Let\'s know some adjectives and
nouns that we\'ll use in our examples:

**Veut {vöt} --** old

**Moll {mol} --** soft

**Pell {pel} --** fur

**Wogh {wog} --** car

**Bell {bel} --** beautiful

**Buland {bulAnd} --** tall

**Amin {amIn} --** reliable *(person)*

**Wassic {wAsik} --** reliable *(things)*

**Yun {yun} --** young

**Smulk {smulk} --** small

**Blou {blu:} --** blue

Some examples:

**Veut wogh --** old car

**Moll pel --** soft fur

Naturally, you can make constructions like that:

**Id wogh est veut --** the car is old

Like in English, the adjectives don\'t receive the -s termination when
in the plural.

**Veut woghs --** old cars

**Moll pels --** soft furs

You may use the adjective alone and make it as a noun:

**The powerful *****woman***** --** i[]{#anchor-123}a staur / ia staura

Notice that you need an article and you can make use of declension, when
possible.

Also it\'s possible to make adjectives from verbs through participles,
but I\'ll explain it only in the chapter about participles.

As in English, you can define the characteristics of someone through the
verb "hab":

**I have blue eyes --** Io ho blou okwi

To create adjectives from substantives, you may make use of affixes like
-ic or -eus, like in the examples below:

**Bois sont cruor*****ic***** {boys sont krwOrik} --** battles are
bloody

**Is est wirt*****ic***** {is est wIrtik} --** he is worthy

**Tod place est danger*****eus***** {tod plAts est dandjërÖs}[^5] --**
this place is dangerous

**Ia gwen est nerv*****eus***** {ya gwen est nervÖs} --** the woman is
nervous

Don\'t worry too much about these affixes because many words can be used
as substantives or adjectives without the necessity of modifying the
word, like "infinitive" in "un infinitive verb"*(an infinitive verb)*.

A *very important observation* is that the vocabulary of Sambahsa comes
from languages of different families, like derivatives from Latin and
Germanic languages, the rules of the making of adjectives from
substantives are adapted according to the origin of the word. See the
examples below:

[]{#anchor-124}[]{#anchor-125}[]{#anchor-126}[]{#anchor-127}**Cid est un
insuleus land --** []{#anchor-128}that is an insular
country[]{#anchor-129} ([]{#anchor-130}**wrong ✘)**

[]{#anchor-131}**Cid est un insulic land --** []{#anchor-132}that is an
insular country ([]{#anchor-133}**wrong ✘)**

[]{#anchor-134}[]{#anchor-135}**Cid est un insular land --**
[]{#anchor-136}that is an insular country ([]{#anchor-137}**correct 🗸)**

[]{#anchor-138}**Som in un problemic situation --** []{#anchor-139}I\'m
in a problematic situation ([]{#anchor-140}**wrong ✘)**

[]{#anchor-141}[]{#anchor-142}**Som in un problematic situation --**
I\'m in a problematic situation []{#anchor-143}**{ correct 🗸)**

[]{#anchor-144}**Un pateric amor --** []{#anchor-145}a paternal love
([]{#anchor-146}**wrong ✘}**

[]{#anchor-147}**Un patruw amor --** a paternal love
([]{#anchor-148}**correct 🗸)**

[]{#anchor-149}**Tod buit monstereus --**
[]{#anchor-150}[]{#anchor-151}that was monstrous (**wrong ✘)**

[]{#anchor-152}**Tod buit monstrueus --** that was monstrous
([]{#anchor-153}**correct 🗸)**

[]{#anchor-154}**Es baygh bayeus --** []{#anchor-155}you\'re very
fearful (**acceptable, but prefer the sentence below)**

[]{#anchor-156}**Es baygh bayasen --** you\'re very fearful (**correct
🗸)**

Sometimes it's not recommended to use an affix for transforming a
substantive in an adjective, but a preposition like "os" or "es" may be
a good alternative.

[]{#anchor-157}**Kamo anon es kwaun --** []{#anchor-158}I like food of
dog

**Lieubho likes RPGs os table --** []{#anchor-159}I love playing
tabletop RPGs

Wouldn\'t make sense to say something like []{#anchor-160}"...kwaunic
anon" or []{#anchor-161}"... []{#anchor-162}tableus RPG", because
"...kwaunic anon" gives the impression of the food has some canine
characteristic, although the food is for dogs, and "...
[]{#anchor-163}tableus RPG" gives the impression that the RPG has a
characteristic of table, although the game normally is played on the
table.

The best way of expressing the ideas of the two last examples is:

**Kamo kwaun-anon --** I like dog food

**Lieubho likes table-RPGs --** I love playing tabletop RPGs

Notice that the "table" of "table-RPG" and the "kwaun" of "kwaun-anon"
are not as adjectives, but as components of a word made through the
agglutination of other words. If, for example, the "table" of
"table-RPG" were an adjective, would be possible the sentence "id RPG
est table", what doesn\'t make the minor sense. Ah, and you can write
"kwaun-anon" and "table-RPG" without the hyphens, leaving them thus:
"kwaun anon" and "table RPG".

Know also the []{#anchor-164}[]{#anchor-165}[]{#anchor-166}predicative
adjective over the object, very used in sentences like the ones of the
below examples:

[]{#anchor-167}**Ho pict mien dom do glend --** I\'ve painted the house
green

**Ia me hat kalen zani --** she has called me adulterous

**Tod anon kwehrt/beuwt me sieug --** this food makes me sick

I\'ll use the first example, "[]{#anchor-168}ho pict mien dom do glend",
to explain more about this kind of situation. We couldn\'t have written
"[]{#anchor-169}ho pict mien dom glend" because the "glend" would be in
the accusative and the translation would be something like "I\'ve
painted my green of house", it wouldn\'t make sense. Also, we couldn\'t
write "[]{#anchor-170}ho pict mien glend dom", because its translation
is "I\'ve painted my green house", which, although it\'s grammatically
perfect, definitively shows the wrong idea.

I think it\'s pertinent to make some observations about these last
examples, they are very interesting.

Notice that, for building the []{#anchor-171}predicative adjective over
the object in the first example, it was made use of the preposition
"do", which you\'ll learn with more details in future chapters, but you
can rewrite these sentences in other way, like for example: "Ho pict(o)
glend(o) mien dom", thus the "glend" is not taken to be the attributive
adjective of "dom".

In the second example I could make the word "zani" a substantive if I
add an indefinite article before this word: "Ia me hat kalen *un* zani";
the meaning practically still is the same. But this case is no more a
[]{#anchor-172}predicative adjective over the object, but a *nominal*
adjective over the object.

There is a better way to write the third sentence, it would be making
use of the suffix -eih, which is a factive, you\'ll learn about affixes
in a specific chapter. The sentence would be thus: "Tod anon sieugeiht
me" *(this food sickens me)*. I didn\'t use it in the examples because
thus the sentence no more would be a predicative adjective over the
object.

I will take the opportunity to teach you how to say "Anna called John
(as) Robert". Well, it\'s exactly like in English: *Anna kiel John (ka)
"Robert"*. I suggest you to use the "ka" in order to avoid
misunderstandings.

As you know, the qualifier precedes the qualified item, but for
quantities, the thing measured can be put after the unit of measure.

**Dwo botels vin --** Two bottles of wine

Regarding the adjectives that introduce a preposition, they work in the
same way that English, as can be seen in the following second sentence:

Latin America hat problemes *qua sont* inexistent in antslohnct lands

Latin America has problems *that are* inexistent in developed countries

Latin America hat problemes inexistent in antslohnct lands

Latin America has problems inexistent in developed countries

For finalizing this part, I want you to observe the three following
expressions knowing that "div" means "god" and "weir" means "war":

Div os Weir

Weir Div

Weirdiv

"Weir Div", "Weirdiv" and "Div os Weir" mean "God of War" and are
different forms of describing the same thing.

[]{#anchor-173}COMPARISONS
--------------------------

The comparison is made suffixing the -er to the adjective (or -ter in
the case the word finishes with a vowel), but only use this ending when
the accentuation of the word is not altered, in other case use the word
"meis", which means "more"; "quem" means "than".

**He is older than me --** is est veuter quem io {is est vÖtër kem yo}

**He is taller than me --** is est meis buland quem io {is est meys
bulAnd kem yo}

Comparisons of equality are made with "tem ... quem", which may be
translated as "as ... as".

**Mary is as beautiful as Elizabeth -- **Maria est tem bell quem
Elizabeth

Comparison od inferiority as made with "minter ... quem", which may be
translated to "less ... than".

**Wolves are less reliable than dogs --** wolfs sont minter amin quem
kwauns {wolfs sont mIntër amIn kem kwAons}

An important observation about the adjective "amin" is that actually it
is for humans, but the other Sambahsa adjective for reliable, which is
"wassic", is for things. Which one use? You choose, I prefered "amin",
but wouldn\'t be wrong to use "wassic", it depends on the person\'s
world perspective.

"Meis" and "minter" *(sometimes \"mins\" instead of \"minter\", but
rare) *are comparative words, now let\'s talk about superlatives. But
what are superlatives? Look the two examples below:

[]{#anchor-174}Charles is taller than Michael

Steven is the tallest

Charles is taller than Michael, but it doesn\'t mean that necessarily
doesn\'t exist people taller than Charles, the "taller" is a
comparative, it only makes the comparison between two beings. But the
second sentence says that Steven is taller than everybody in the context
where he is, "tallest" is a superlative. Of course, the same thought
applies to comparisons of inferiority:

Charles is less tall than Michael

Steven is the less tall

The superlatives are "meist", which means "most", and "minst", which
means "less". Look the examples below:

[]{#anchor-175}**Matthew is the tallest --** Matthew est is meist buland

**Matthew is the less tall --** Matthew est is minst buland

**I am the most young in my house --** som is yunst in mien dom

**Sharon is the most reliable woman --** Sharon est ia aminst gwen

The adjectives "megil" {mEdjil} *(large)* and "lytil" {lÜtil} *(little)*
are the only ones that have irregular comparative and superlative forms,
they are:

**Comparative:** "meger" {mEdjër} and "lyter" {lÜtër}

**Superlative:** "megst" {megst} and "lytst" {lütst}

[]{#anchor-176}PLURAL
=====================

The plural is easy and intuitive, often the words in plural have a -s
added in their endings, as made in English, this is basically the
standard form.

**Prince {prints} *****(prince)***** --** princes {prIntsës} *(princes)*

**Div {div}***** (god)***** --** divs {divs} *(gods)*

**Kwaun {kwAon} *****(dog)***** --** kwauns {kwAons} *(gods)*

**Land {land} *****(country)***** --** lands {landz} *(countries)*

Words finished with -um have its final replaced by -a.

**Territorium {te(r)ritOryum} *****(territory)***** --** territoria
{te(r)ritOrya} *(territories)*

**Collegium {kolEdjyum} *****(college)***** --** collegia {kol(l)Edjya}
*(colleges)*

For words finished with -es or -os, these terminations are replaced
respectively for -si e -sa.

**Daumos {dAomos} *****(marvel)***** --** daumsa {dAomsa} *(marvels)*

**Elkos {Elkos} *****(ulcer)***** --** elksa (Elksa) *(ulcers)*

**Bes {bes} *****(boss) *****--** besi {bEzi} *(bosses)*

**Kames {kams} *****(spell)***** --** kamsa {kamsa} *(spells)*

There will situations that it\'s not possible to add a -s at the end of
the word for pronunciation issues, in such cases, you can optionally use
declensions:

**Magv {magv} *****(child)***** -- **magv(i) {mAgv(i)} *(children)*

**Kwax {kwaks} *****(croack)***** --** kwax(a) {kwAks(a)} *(croacks)*

**Urx {urks} *****(bear)***** --** urx(i) {Urks(i)} *(bears)*

**Rawaj {rawAj} *****(currency unit)***** --** rawaj(a) {rawAj(a)}
*(currency units)*

**Aux {Aoks} *****(ox)***** --** aux(i) {Aoks(i)} *(oxen)*

**Kwas {kwas} *****(cough)***** --** kwas(a) {kwAz(a)} *(cough)*

**Musch {muc} *****(fly)***** --** musch(i) {mUc(i)} *(flies)*

Observe that the examples above are for the nominative case. Here is an
example for clarification:

**Magvi eddent muschens --** children eat flies

**Muschi kament magvens --** flies like children

Declension rules are "relaxed" for nouns and adjectives, so you can
generalize that -i is for animated beings and -a is for inanimate beings
even in the position of accusative or dative.

**Magvi eddent muschi --** children eat flies

**Muschi kament magvi --** flies like children

The only exception is "ok" (eye), whose plural can be "oks" {oks} or
"okwi" {Okwi}.

Some examples with articles:

**The men --** ies wirs {yes wirs}

**The women --** ias gwens {yas gwens}

**The cars --** ia woghs {ya wogz}

**The persons --** i anghens {i Angëns}

**The dogs --** i kwauns {i kwAons}

**The people --** i leuds {i lödz}

Please notice that even the articles are modified, while "the man" is
"is wir", "the men" is "ies wirs".

For finishing, an example of plural with declension:

**Plur millions brasileiren --** several millions of Brazilians

Notice that was written "brasileiren" instead "brasileirs", but I could
use anyone without problems, but if you use "brasilers", don\'t forget
to use the "em", that would be "Plur millions em brasileirs vahnt..."

[]{#anchor-184}ARE YOU A BIT CONFUSE WITH SO MANY "MUCHS" AND "FEWS"?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You must observe what is an adjective, what is adverb, and what is both,
it is very important! Let\'s see the implications of that:

"Baygh" may not be used before an adjective followed by a substantive, a
sentence like "baygh smulk magvi" would mean what? "many small children"
or "very small children"? Remember that "baygh" can be used as adjective
as adverb, so there is the doubt of what word it qualifies. In such
cases the ideal is to use a more specific word, one that is only an
adjective or only an adverb. *"Baygh" exists to avoid the repetition of
"maung" in a text*.

Look: "maung belli leuds" {mAong bEli lödz}, I know that this sentence
means "many beautiful persons", but *not* "very beautiful persons",
because of "maung" only serves as an adjective.

I believe you already understand it. Some good examples for you to fix
it in your mind:

***Maung***** smulk magvi --** []{#anchor-185}many small children

***Meg***** smulk magvi --** []{#anchor-186}very small children

**Tod land hat *****pauk***** bella plaja --** []{#anchor-187}this
country has few beautiful beachs

**Tod land hat *****pau***** bella plaja --** this country has not-very
beautiful beachs

You can see that some words mentioned above work sometimes as an
adjective, and sometimes as an adverb. What makes the difference? It is
an adjective when it refers to the quantity of the substantive, but
it\'s an adverb when it refers to the quality of the adjective.

**Volo lyt cofie --** I want a little of coffee

**Lyt-ye bitter cofie --** Slightly bitter coffee

To differentiate them when there is a risk of confusion, use the
hyphenated ending "-ye" for adverbs, and, if possible, the "euphonic"
declensional endings for adjectives.

About "destull":

What differentiates "destull" of words like "meg" ou "baygh" is that
"destull" is at an inferior level, see the examples below for you to
understand:

**Brasilu est meg/baygh bell --** Brazil is very beautiful *(in the
superior category of beauty)*

**Brasilu est destull bell --** Brazil is quite beautiful *(it is
beautiful, but there are other countries that are more beautiful)*

You can also translate "destull" as "kinda".

[]{#anchor-188}NUMBERS
======================

Here are the numbers from 0 to 10:

**0 -- zero {dzEro} --** zero

**1 -- oin {oyn} --** one

**2 -- dwo {dwo} --** two

**3 -- tri {tri} --** three

**4 -- quar {kwar} --** four

**5 -- penk(we) {penk(wë)} --** five

**18 -- octdem {Oktdëm} --** eighteen

**19 -- nevdem {nEvdëm} --** nineteen

For numbers like 20, 30, 40, ..., 90 you use the suffix -gim

**20 -- dwogim {dwOdjim} --** twenty

**30 -- trigim {trIdjim} -- **thirty

**40 -- quargim {kwArdjim} -- **forty

**50 -- penkgim {pEnkdjim} --** fifty

**90 -- nevgim {nEvdjim} --** ninety

Here are the numbers 100, 1000, 1000000 and 1000000000:

**100 -- cent(om) {tsent}/{tsëntOm} --** one hundred

**1000 -- mil {mil} --** one thousand

**1000000 -- oin million {oyn milyOn} --** one million

**1000000000 -- oin milliard {oyn milyArd} --** one billion

Some examples of numbers:

**23 -- dwogim tri --** twenty three

**130 -- cent trigim --** one hundred and thirty

**569 -- penkcent sixgim nev --** f[]{#anchor-189}ive hundred and
sixty-nine

**1992 -- mil nevcent nevgim dwo --** []{#anchor-190}one thousand nine
hundred ninety-two

Cardinal numbers are made with the suffix -t (or -im if the first suffix
for incompatible).

**First --** ~~oint~~ prest *(if it\'s the first of a group of two, we
use "preter" instead "prest")*

**Second --** dwot *(or "second", equal to the English word)*

**Third -- **trit

**Fourth--** quart

**Fifth --** penkt

**Sixth --** sixt

**Seventh --** septim

**Eighth --** octim

**Ninth --** nevt

**Tenth --** dect

**Eleventh --** oindemt

Yes, "first" and "second" are irregular, despite be admitted the "dwot".

Only the last component needs termination:

**Twenty-first --** dwogim prest *(or "dwogim-prest", with hyphen)*

Know these too:

**Last --** senst *(superlative)*

**Latter --** senter *(comparative)*

A multiplier is made with the suffix -(en)s:

**Once --** oins

**Twice --** dwis *(irregular)*

[]{#anchor-191}**Thrice --** tris

We also may use the word "ker":

**Once --** oin ker

**Twice --** dwo kers

**Thrice --** tri kers

The distributive is made with the suffix -(e)n, but there are irregular
forms:

**1 --** ein

**2 --** dwin *("duo") *(for the word "pair" exists the word "pair",
yeah, it\'s the same word)

**12 -- **douzen *(our "dozen"!)*

**1000 --** tusent

For numbers finished in -dem or -gim, you use -tia instead -(e)n.

**20 --** []{#anchor-192}dwogimtia *(like a score)*

This termination -(e)n also is used for counting nouns that don\'t have
a form in the singular:

**Mi ho kaupen trin bruks --** I've bought myself three pairs of pants

If the distributive is used as quantity, then the nouns and adjectives
are in the plural of genitive.

**Un centen wolfen gwiviet in France --** a []{#anchor-193}hundred
wolves could live in France

Remember of "million" and "milliard"? They only exist in the
distributive form. But when the distributive is followed by another
number, the distributive no more need to be in the infinitive.

**1 891 400 humans --** Oino million octcent nevgim oino mil quarcent
mensci

Parts can be indicated by -del.

**One third --** tridel

But look:

**Half *****(as substantive) *****--** []{#anchor-194}dwidel

**Half *****(as adjective)***** --** pwol *(often used as prefix)*

**Ho edden un pwolkhlayb --** I\'ve eaten half a loaf (of bread)

**Pwolter --** ~~1.5~~ 1,5

About punctuation in numbers, Sambahsa is different from English, the
fractional numbers don\'t receive a dot, but a comma; a number like "two
and a half" is transcribed as "2,5" in Sambahsa, not "2.5". Numbers
superior to 999 don\'t receive any punctuation, only a space if you
want, so "one million" won't be transcribed as "1,000,000", but as
"1000000" or "1 000 000".

The other 0,5 is taken using the ordinal form of the next number after
the "pwol". Look one more example:

**Pwolpenkt -- **4,5

**Pwolnevt --** 8,5

**Pwol --** 0,5 *(in practice, "pwol" is translated as "half", not as
"zero point five"[^6])*

Math operations:

**2 + 2 = 4 --** dwo plus dwo kwehr(n)t[^7] quar

**2 − 2 = 0 --** dwo minus/ex dwo kwehr(n)t zero

**2 − 3 = −1 --** dwo minus/ex tri kwehr(n)t minus oin

**2 ⨯ 2 = 4 --** dwo kers dwo kwehr(n)t quar

**2 ÷ 2 = 1 --** dwo dividen ab dwo kwehr(n)t oin

** --** tri ep quar = tri quardels

**--** sept(a) ep oct(o) = sept(a) octdels

-- penk(we) ep sixdem = penk(we) sixdemdels[^8]

**6¹ =** six alt oin

**6² =** six alt quadrat

**6² =** six alt dwo

**6³ =** six alt cube

**6³ =** six alt tri

**6⁴ =** six alt quar

**6⁵ =** six alt penk(we)

** =** quadrat raudh os six

** =** cubic raudh os six

Score or result of voting, like the result of a soccer game where
Barcelona scored two goals and Real Madrid scored one.

**Dwo contra oin pro Barcelona --** two to one to Barcelona

**Oin contra dwo pro Real Madrid --** one to two to Real Madrid

For indicating age, you use the suffix -at:

**Som dwogim sixat --** I am twenty six years old

**Cid monument est milat --** that monument is one thousand years old

[]{#anchor-195}TIME
===================

To indicate the day of a month, we put "dien" before the cardinal number
of the date:

[]{#anchor-196}Dien quar jul mil septcent septgim six, ia Uniet Stats
bihr independent

On the fourth of July of one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six,
United States became independent

Dien sept september mil octcent dwogim dwo, Brasilu bihsit independent

On the seventh of September of one thousand eight hundred and twenty
two, Brazil became independent

The days of the week:

**Mingo {mIngo} --** Sunday

**Mundie **[]{#anchor-197}[]{#anchor-198}**{mundI:} --** Monday

**Ardie {ardI:} --** Tuesday

**Credie **[]{#anchor-199}**{krëdI:} --** Wednesday

**Khamsi {qAmsi} --** Thursday

**Juma **[]{#anchor-200}**{jUma} --** Friday

**Sabd {sabd} --** Saturday

Here are the months:

**Januar {januAr} --** January

**Februar {februAr} --** February

**Mart {mart} --** March

**Aprile {aprIl} --** April

**Mai {mä} -- **May

**Jun {jun} --** June

**Jul {jul} -- **July

**August {aogUst} --** Agust

**September {sëptEmbër} --** September

**October {oktObër} --** October

**November {novEmbër} --** November

**December {dëtsEmbër} --** December

To indicate the time, you put the numbers of the hours and minutes
*(separated by a colon)* before the word "saat" {saAt}:

**18:49 saat --** octdem saat quargim nev *(forty-nine minutes past six
p.m.)*

**05:00 saat --** penk saat *(five o\'clock)*

If you want, you don't have to write "saat" when in the numeric form,
"18:49" and "05:00" are enough.

Another way:

**06:49 saat vesper --** six saat quargim nev vesper *(six forty-nine
p.m.)*

**05:00 saat aghyern --** penk saat aghyern *(five o\'clock a.m.)*

In order to indicate a determined decade, like "the 1970\'s", you inform
the year more the termination -tias.

**Ia 1970tias --** **Ia mil nevcent septgimtias --** the 1970\'s

To indicate the century we can say something like this:

**Gwivmos in id dwogim-prest secule, poskwo sessiet id dwogim-dwot
secule, prever eet id dwogimt secule, ed pre tod eet id nevdemt secule
--** We live in the twenty-first century, then it will be the
twenty-second century, before it was the twentieth century and before
this one was the nineteenth century

In the place of "dwogim-prest" and "dwogim-dwot" you may say
respectively "dwogim-oint"[^9] and "dwogim-second" if you want.

An adverb of period may be made per the termination -s.

**I beis, qui wey eiskwmos, appareihnt noct*****s***** --** The bees,
which we want, appears at night

The present period of time may be indicated by the prefix ho-:

**Tonight -- **honoct

**This evening --** hovesper

But "today" and "this morning" are made in the following ways:

**Today --** hoyd

**This morning --** Todeghern

A verb that indicates a period of spent time can be made per the prefix
(u)per-.

**Passe ad upernocte in mien dom -- **Spend the night in my house

**Uperdienam in id farm --** We spent the day in the farm

There the translations for "tomorrow, "yesterday" and their variations:

**Tomorrow --** cras

**Yesterday -- **ghes

**After tomorrow --** poscras

**Of yesterday --** ghestern

**Before yesterday --** []{#anchor-201}preghes {prëgEs}

More important words:

**Hourly --** []{#anchor-202}horlong

**Last week --** []{#anchor-203}perhvdi {pEr(h)vdi}

**Every time --** []{#anchor-204}stets *(used in general with
comparatives)*

**In times past --** []{#anchor-205}xiawngja {ksyAwngja}

**Last night --** yarlay {yarlAy}

**Day & night *****(24 horas)***** --** yawm {yAwm}

[]{#anchor-206}CORRELATIVES AND SOME IMPORTANT **WORD**S
========================================================

Correlatives are words made by affixing certain particles to the
interrogative pronouns or other words, like "anghen" *(person)*, "ject"
*(thing)* and "loc" *(place)*.

**Sem- {sem} -- **some

**-quid {kid} --** any *(complete uncertainly, often it's pejorative)*

> **Is lehct quodquid --** he's telling anything at all

**-gvonc {gvonk} --** it is between "some" and "any".

> **Ne has clus id dwer. Quelgvonc ghehdiet entre id dom --** you
> haven\'t closed the door. Anyone/Someone could enter the house

> **Ne has tu dar mathen od mien intelligence est dar staurer quem
> quodgvonc eins? --** haven\'t you learnt yet that my intelligence is
> still mightier than any sword?

**-kwe {kwë} --** when suffixed to interrogative pronouns corresponds to
the English -ever *(but with an idea of totality in a sentence)*

> **Ir gwelsa brungend quodkwe spalt iom armurs --** their shafts taking
> advantage of any split of the armours

> **Querkwe gwahm, io incontre prients --** wherever I go, I encounter
> friends

**-libt {libd} --** any *(in the sense of "whichever you want" or "at
one\'s pleasure")*

> **Cheus quodlibt fustan {tcös kwOdlibt fustAn} -- **Choose any skirt
> *(the one you prefer)*

A comparison for better understanding, the two sentences below mean
"any/whichever shoe is useful for me":

> **Quodquid schou est util pro me:** means that the person doesn't care
> about the shoe to be worn in his foot

> **Quodkwe schou est util pro me:** it's more serious

> Another example:

> **Ia sayct quodquid -- **she tells anything at all *(it's a mad
> woman)*

> **Ia sayct quodkwe --** she says anything *(it means probably that she
> is an intellectual that knows diverse areas of knowledge)*

**Semanghen, semquel {semAngën, semkEl} --** someone

**Quelgvonc {këlgvOnk} --** anyone

**Cadanghen {kadAngën} --** everybody

**Quodquid {kwOdkid} --** anything *(pejorative sense)*

**Quodgvonc {kwodgvOnk} --** anything

**Quodkwe {kwOdkwë} --** whatever

**Quiskwe {kIskwë} --** whoever

*For saying sentences like "I don\'t see (any)thing", you can say "ne
vido ject", it\'s used "ject" in these cases when in negative sentences.
But a better way of expressing would be "vido neid"* ("I see nothing")*.
When we talk about persons we use the word "anghen".*

**Ma? {ma} --** why?

**Itak {itAk} --** that\'s why

**Kam? {kam} --** how?, like, as *(comparative of equity, this word also
means the verb "like")*

**Katha {kA§a} --** so, thus

**Ka {ka} --** as (a) *(quality, function)*

**It(han) {it}/{i§An} --** so, this way

[]{#anchor-207}**Zowngschie {dzowngcI:} /dzowŋ\'ʃi/ --** anyway

**-med {med} --** *suffixed to a pronoun in the genitive, it has the
meaning of "per/through" + instrument. quosmed {kwOsmëd} (with what? /
by which means?); tosmed {tOsmëd} (with that / through that means)*

**Quayt {kwayt} --** how much, how many *(pronoun)*

**Tant {tant} --** so much, so many *(adverb/adjective)*

**Semanghen, semquis, semqua {semAngën, semkis, semkwA} --** someone

**Hetos / Hois {hEtos / hoys} --** hence

**Ter {ter} --** there

**Tetro {tEtro} --** thither

**Tetos / tois {tEtos / toys} --** thence

**Cer {tser} --** yonder

**Cetro {tsEtro} --** to yonder

**Cetos / ciois {tsEtos / tsyoys} --** from yonder

**Semloc/semquer, semtro, semtos {semlOk/semkEr, sEmtro, sEmtos} --**
somewhere

**Quantloc/quanter, quantro, quantos/quantois {kwantlOk/kwAntër,
kwAntro, kwAntos/kwantOys} --** everywhere

**Neidloc/nequer, netro, netos {neydlOk/neker, nEtro, nEtos} --**
nowhere

**Alyer, altro, altos/alyois {Alyër, Altro, Altos/alyOys} --** elsewhere

"Left" and "right" are represented respectively by lev(ter) and
dex(ter), naturally that are possible forms like levtro/dextro and
levtos/dextos.

"Outside" and "inside" are represented respectively by "exo" and "eni"
*(irregular words)*, are possible forms like extro/extos and
entro/entos.

An adverb of direction can be made per the suffix -worts, like in "Vasya
fluvs sreunt marworts" {vAsya fluvz srönt marwOrtz} ("all rivers flow to
the sea" or "all rivers flow seawards"). Yeah, -worts equals to -wards.

An adverb of location can be made, rarely, per the termination -i.

**Ghomi {gOmi} --** on the ground

**Urbi {Urbi} --** downtown

**Domi {dOmi} --** in the house

**Hemi {hEmi} --** at home

**Ub {ub} --** up

**Qualg? {kwalg} --** Which?

**Solg, talg {solg, talg} --** Such

**Quod? {kwod} --** What?[]{#anchor-208}

**Semject, semquod {semjEkt, semkwOd} --** something

**Quant(o/um) {kwAnt(o/um)} --** everything

**Quant est correct --** everything is correct

Quant- may serve as a relative pronoun, you only have to add the
declension terminations to it.

**Khich {qitc} --** nothing at all

**Quan(do) {kwAn(do)}? --** when?

**Kun {kun} --** when, as

**Kun gnahsim, mien scol dar ne existit --** when I born, my school
still didn1t existed

**Ye id dien kun is mohr, vasyi buir trauric --** On the day he died,
everybody were sad

As relative pronouns, there is no difference between "kun" and
"quan(do)", but only "quan(do)" may be used in the interrogative form.

**Yando {yAndo} --** sometimes

**Ops {ops} --** often

**Nun {nun} --** nun

**Yant {yant} --** as soon as

**Tun {tun} --** then

"Tun" is equivalent to the Sambahsa expressions: "ye tod tid", "in tod
condition", etc

**Semper {sEmpër} --** always

**Naiw(o) {nÄw(o)} --** never

**Nuntos {nUntos} --** from now on

**Tuntos {tUntos} --** for this time/epoch

**Cada {kAda} --** each, every

[]{#anchor-209}THE VERBS
========================

Ah, the verbs...

With the exception of the three main verbs, "es" {es}, "hab" {hab} and
"woid" {woyd}, all the other verbs are regular, you only need to pay
attention to some cases predicted by the orthographic rules.

It\'s common, in other languages, that the base form of the verbs is
represented in the infinitive form. But in Sambahsa, the standard form
of presentation is in the form of *stem*. I wanna make it clear from now
on, the translations from Sambahsa to English will be provided in the
infinitive form, even when the verbs are in their original form *(only
the stem)*. For example: the verb "sedd" is translated to "to sit"
*(infinitive just in the English translation!)*, but actually "sedd" is
not the infinitive form of the word, its infinitive form is "sedde".
Don\'t worry because I\'ll warn you when the verb is in the infinitive,
I only want you to know that when I show you something like "linekw = to
leave", don\'t think that "linekw" already is the Sambahsa verb in the
infinitive form. Are we understood?

Let\'s meet the irregular verbs:

**Es {es} --** to be

**Hab {hab} --** to have

**Woid {woyd} --** to know

[]{#anchor-210}"Es", "hab" and "woid" are verbs in the stem form, the
infinitive form of them are respectively "ses", "habe" and "woide". You
don\'t need to worry a lot about "es", "hab" and "woid" since these
verbs are irregular.

I need to make a special comment about the verb "woid". The word "woid"
means that you have the knowing of a fact or information, like in "he
knows when to leave" or "I know Chinese"; "kehgn" is for expressing the
familiarity with someone, some place or something, like in "they know
Oliver" or "I know China". We also have the verb "gnoh", which
essentially has both meanings. But "kehgn" and "gnoh" are not irregular
like "woid", "es" and "hab".

[]{#anchor-211}PRESENT
----------------------

You already know the conjugation of the verb "es" in the present, but
[]{#anchor-212}it\'s no bother to repeat them:

**Som {som} --** *(I)* am

**Es {es} --** *(you)* are *(singular)*

**Est {est} --** *(he/she/it)* is

**Smos {smos} --** *(we)* are

**Ste {ste} --** *(you)* are *(plural)*

**Sont {sont} --** *(they)* are

The pronouns were omitted, but you are entirely free to use them! Look
the very same conjugation from above, but with the pronouns:

**Io som {yo som} --** I am

**Tu es {tu es} --** you are

**Is/Ia/Id/El est {is/ya/id/el est} --** he/she/it is

**Wey smos {wey smos} --** we are

**Yu Ste {yu ste} --** you are

**Ies/Ias/Ia/I sont {yes/yas/ya/i sont} --** they are

From now I\'ll omit the pronouns in the conjugations, but know you may
use them! It\'s just a personal choice of mine.

Now let\'s see the conjugations of the verbs "hab" and "woid":

**Ho {ho} --** *(I)* have

**Has {has} --** *(you)* have *(singular)*

**Hat {hat} --** *(he/she/it)* has

**Habmos / Hams {hAbmos / hams} --** *(we)* have

**Yu habte {yu habd} --** *(you)* have *(plural)*

**Habent / Hant {hAbënt / hant} --** *(they)* have

**Woidim {wOydim} --** *(I)* know

**Woidst(a) {wOydst(a)} --** *(you)* know *(singular)*

**Woidit {wOydit} --** *(he/she/it)* knows

**Woidam {woydAm} --** *(we)* know

**Woidat {woydAt} --** *(you)* know *(plural)*

**Woideer {woydEër} --** *(they)* know

The conjugation of woid is not compulsory.

The conjugation of verbs in the present is made with the following
endings:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-213}**person singular:** -m *(when after
the sound of vowel or {y})*, -o *(in other cases). If the stem of the
verb ends with -e or if the addition of -o would be incompatible with
the accentuation, add nothing but use the personal pronoun "io".*

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -s

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -t

**1**^**st**^** person plural:** -m(o)s *(use the one compatible with
the accentuation)*

**2**^**nd**^** person plural:** -t(e)

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -(e)nt, -e *(use the one compatible
with the accentuation)*

Let\'s see an example:

**I love you --** Te lieubho {te lyÖbo}

**You love me --** M[]{#anchor-214}e lieubhs {me lyÖbs}

**She loves him --** Ia lieubht iom {ya lyÖbt yom}

**The dog loves the woman --** El kwaun lieubht iam gwen {el kwAon lyöbt
yam gwen}

**We love them *****(in this case "them" refers to female persons)*****
--** Lieubhmos ians {lyÖbmos yans}

**You love us *****("you" is in the plural)***** --** Yu lieubhte nos
{yu lyÖbt nos}

**They love me --** Ies lieubhent me {yes lyÖbënt me}

Since the pronouns are often easy to identify (whether they are
nominative, accusative, etc) you are free to change the order of them in
the sentence, but maintain the good sense for avoiding
misunderstandings. You may say too:
"[]{#anchor-215}[]{#anchor-216}[]{#anchor-217}[]{#anchor-218}lieubho
te", "lieubhs me", "[]{#anchor-219}io []{#anchor-220}lieubho te", "tu
lieubhs me", "te []{#anchor-221}lieubho io", "me lieubhs tu".

Another example to you understand it well:

***(I)***** learn Sambahsa --** Euco Sambahsa {Öko sambA:sa}

***(You)***** learn Sambahsa --** Eucs Sambahsa {öks sambA:sa}

***(He/she/it)***** learns Sambahsa --** Euct Sambahsa {ökt sambA:sa}

***(We)***** learn Sambahsa --** Eucmos Sambahsa {Ökmos sambA:sa}

***(You)***** learn Sambahsa --** Yu eucte Sambahsa {yu ökt sambA:sa}

***(They)***** learn Sambahsa --** Eucent Sambahsa {Ötsënt sambA:sa}

[]{#anchor-222}BRIEF EXPLANATION ABOUT THE NASAL INFIX
------------------------------------------------------

I will talk about the nasal infix with more details in an appropriate
chapter, but as I'll need that you have a notion about this subject
right now, I\'ll show you a quick explanation.

A verb with nasal infix has an *un*stressed "e" together the consonants
"m" or "n". In all verbal tenses, except a form of imperative that uses
the own stem form of the verb, this kind of verb will suffer an
alteration, which basically is a lost of the unstressed "e" and, maybe,
some other modifications that I will explain in the appropriate chapter.

Look at how it works:

**Lin*****e*****kw {lInëkw} →** linkw {linkw}

**Preg*****e*****n {prEdjën} →** pregn {preny}

You may question: but why Sambahsa has this characteristic? Sambahsa
behaves like a natural language, if you analyze it well, it\'s more
pleasant to speak in this way, people naturally would want to drop this
unstressed "e". Without this rule, the language could be a bit easier,
but it wouldn\'t be much comfortable to speak. Do you doubt me? Check
whether the *in*correct conjugation below is pleasant to pronounce:

Linekwe {linEkwë}

Linekwo {linEkwo}

Linekws {linEkus}

Linekwt {linEkut}

Linekwm(o)s {linEkum(o)s}

Linekwte {linEkut}

Linekwnt {linEkunt}

It becomes a mess, if you look it well you\'ll notice that that
pronunciation is not very natural or human! Now see these words properly
conjugated:

linkwes {lInkwës}

linkwo {lInkwo}

linkws {lInkus}

linkwt {lInkut}

linkwm(o)s {lInkum(o)s}

linkwte {lInkut}

linkwnt {lInkunt}

It\'s much better, isn't?

I hope you understand that this nasal infix rule is not here by chance,
it is very necessary. But don\'t worry, before you know it you'll be
applying this rule in your speaking by nature.

[]{#anchor-223}PAST TENSE
-------------------------

There are two verbal tenses in the past for the verb "es", the simple
past and the imperfect, while the first one informs about an action that
takes place in a punctual time in the past, the second one deals with
situations that happened continuously in the past and ended.

Simple past

**Buim {bwim} --** []{#anchor-224}*(I)* was

**Buist(a) {bwIst(a)} --** []{#anchor-225}*(you)* were

**Buit {bwit} --** []{#anchor-226}*(he/she/it)* was

**Buam {bwam} --** []{#anchor-227}*(we)* were

**Buat {bwat} --** []{#anchor-228}*(you)* were

**Buir {bwir} --** []{#anchor-229}*(they)* were

Imperfect past

**Eem {Eëm} --** *(I)* was

**Ees {Eës} --** *(you)* were

**Eet {Eët} --** *(he/she/it)* was

**Eemos {Eëmos} --** *(we)* were

**Yu eete {yu Eët} --** *(you)* were

**Eent {Eënt} --** *(they)* were

Try see these verbs from "imperfect past" like "I used to be", "you used
to be", "she was being", "we were being".

Both "hab" and "woid" only have the simple past.

**Hiebim {hyEbim} --** *(I)* had

**Hiebst(a) {hyEbst} --** *(you)* had

**Hiebit {hyEbit} --** *(he/she/it)* had

**Hiebam {hyebAm} --** *(we)* had

**Hiebat {hyebAt} --** *(you)* had

**Hiebeer {hyebEër} --** *(they)* had

**Woisim {wOyzim} --** *(I)* knew

**Woisist {wOyzist} --** *(you)* knew

**Woisit {wOyzit} --** *(je/she/it)* knew

**Woisam {woyzAm} --** *(we)* knew

**Woisat {woyzAt} -- ***(you)* knew

**Woiseer {woyzEër} --** *(they)* knew

The conjugation of the verb "wois" is not compulsory.

The conjugation of the verbs in the simple past is made by the following
terminations:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-230}**person singular:** -im

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -(i)st(a) *(use the one compatible
with the accentuation)*

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -it

**1**^**st**^** person plural:** -am

**2**^**nd**^** person plural:** -at

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -eer *(it\'s -r when the verb finishes
with an accentuated vowel)*

Between the stem of the verb and the ending of the conjugation, it would
be better to make use of the -s-, when the stem ends with the sound of
vowel, but it\'s not mandatory! Look an example below:

[]{#anchor-231}**ghyah {gya:} --** to gape

**ghyah + s + it = ghyahsit {gyA:sit} --** *(he/she/it)* gaped

An example to you understand:

[]{#anchor-232}***(***[]{#anchor-233}***I)***** browed --** brovim
{brOvim}

***(You)***** browed -- **brovist {brOvist} *or* brovsta {brOvzta}

***(He/she/it)***** browed --** brovit {brOvit}

***(We)***** browed --** brovam {brovAm}

***(You)***** browed -- **brovat {brovAt}

***(They)***** browed --** broveer {brovEër}

"Brovista" is not possible because the "a" would change the accentuation
of the word.

Apropos, "brov" also means the substantive "eyebrow".

**Attention:** the conjugation of the verbs in the past, whose stems are
altered, is *not* compulsory!

I know that is kinda ridiculous repeat it, but it\'s in the case still
exists doubts. You may say "io buim", "wey brovam", "tu ees", etc, using
the pronouns. It\'s the last time I notify you of this possibility, my
conjugations are made without the pronouns, but it doesn\'t mean that
they may not be used! I say the same for any verbal tense.

### []{#anchor-234}ACTUALLY THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF REPRESENTING THE PAST

What you\'ve just seen is the simple past, Sambahsa also has the present
perfect like English:

**Is gwivit in Rome unte oct yars --** He lived in Rome for eight years

**Is hat gwiwt in Rome unte oct yars --** He has lived in Rome for wight
years

**Ia ghiet iom **[]{#anchor-235}**gouverneur --** S[]{#anchor-236}he met
the governor

**Ia hat ghaten iom gouverneur --** She has met the governor

**Lusim mien cleich --** I lost my key

**Ho lusen mien cleich --** []{#anchor-237}I\'ve lost my key

[]{#anchor-238}INFINITIVE
-------------------------

You were expecting that I would talk about the future tense, weren\'t? I
will talk about the future tense in another opportunity because I will
need the infinitive to explain it.

**Ses {ses} --** to be

**Habe {hab} --** to have

**Woide {woyd} --** to know

Verbs finished in an unstressed "e" don\'t change:

**Accepte {ak(t)sEpt(ë)} --** Accepte *(accepet)*

For verbs with the nasal infix, the unstressed "e" is removed and it\'s
added the termination -es.

Verbs with "ei"{ey} or "eu"{ö} have these parts replaced respectively
for "i" and "u" and is added the termination -es.

**Linekw {lInëkw}** -- linkwes {lInkwës} *(to leave)*

**Dreiv {dreyv} --** drives {drivz} *(to drift)*

[]{#anchor-239}**Ghieul {giÖl} --** ghiules {gyüls} *(to carbonize)*

In all the other cases it\'s enough to add the final -e when it doesn\'t
change the accentuation, if the accentuation is altered the word simply
remains unaltered.

[]{#anchor-240}**Garabat {garabAt} --** garabate {garabAt} *(to
scribble)*

**Hinder {hIndër} -- **hinder {hIndër} *(to hinder)*

Let\'s see a practical example:

**Tehrbo kaupe anon {tE:rbo kAop anOn} --** I have to buy food

**Tehrb {te:rb} --** have to

***Kaup {kAop} --** buy*

### []{#anchor-241}THE USE OF THE PREPOSITION "AD" WITH VERBS IN THE INFINITIVE

You\'ve known an example of the following kind:

**Ghohdim kaupe un wogh {gO:dim kAop un wog} --** I could buy a car

**Pitim nices un wir {pItim nItsës un wir} --** I tried to kill a man

But verbs that denote movement you must use the preposition "ad", which
you will know with more details in a future chapter. That happens
because Sambahsa infinitives behave like substantives, except those ones
that don\'t use any article.

**Ia ihsit *****ad***** vide sien son {ya I:sit ad vid syen son} --**
She went []{#anchor-242}to see her son

A situation where the verb is explicitly used as substantive:

**Is hehlpt iom *****ad***** tarjmes id dictionar do portughesche {is
he:lpt yom ad tArjmës id diktyonAr do portugEc} --** He helps him to
translate the dictionary to Portuguese

Other similar situation, but with two verbs in the infinitive:

**(Tu) has gwiven kay hehlpe *****ad***** cree un nov mund {(tu) has
gwIvën kay he:lp ad krEë un nov mund} --** you have lived to help create
a new world

[]{#anchor-243}FUTURE
---------------------

The conjugations of the three main verbs:

**Sessiem {sesyEm} --** []{#anchor-244}*(I)* will be

**Sessies {sesyEs} --** *(you)* will be

**Sessiet {sesyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* will be

**Sessiemos {sesyEmos} --** *(we)* will be

**Yu sessiete {yu sesyEt} --** *(you)* will be

**Sessient {sesyEnt} --** *(they)* will be

**Habsiem {habsyEm} --** []{#anchor-245}*(I)* will have

**Habsies {habsyEs} --** *(you)* will have

**Habsiet {habsyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* will have

**Habsiem(o)s {habsyEm(o)s} --** *(we)* will have

**Yu habsiete {yu habsyEt} --** *(you)* will have

**Habsient {habsyEnt} --** *(they)* will have

**Woidsiem {woydsyEm} --** []{#anchor-246}*(I)* will know

**Woidsies {woydsyEs} --** *(you* will know

**Woidsiet {woydsyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* will know

**Woidsiem(o)s {woydsyEm(o)s} --** *(we)* will know

**Yu woidsiete {yu woydsyEt} --** *(you)* will know

**Woidsient {woydsyEnt} --** *(they)* will know

The conjugation of the verbs in the future is made in two ways:

In the first one you use the verbal form in the 2^nd^ person singular
plus the particle "ie" and the conjugations of present, look an example
below:

**You permit --** permitts {përmItz} *(2*^*nd*^* person singular in the
present)*

[]{#anchor-247}[]{#anchor-248}***(I)***** will permit -- **permittsiem
{përmitsyEm}

***(You)***** will permit --** permittsies {përmitsyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** will permit --** permittsiet {përmitsyEt}

***(We)***** will permit --** permittsiem(o)s {përmitsyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** will permit --** yu permittsiete {yu përmitsyEt}

Notice that "permittsiem" is the "siem permitte" with the auxiliary as
suffix.

In the second form you use the auxiliary sie- (conjugated!) plus the
verb in the infinitive, look the same example from above conjugated in
this way:

[]{#anchor-249}***(I)***** will permit --** siem permitte {syem permIt}

***(You)***** will permit --** sies permitte {syes permIt}

***(He/she/it)***** will permit --** siet permitte {syet permIt}

***(We)***** will permit --** siem(o)s permitte {syEm(o)s permIt}

***(You)***** will permit --** yu siete permitte {yu syet permIt}

***(They)***** will permit --** sient permitte {syent permIt}

We also have a negative version of the above conjugation, the auxiliary
nie-, but in this one we can\'t put a suffix in the verb, that is to
say, we can't have something like "permittniem":

[]{#anchor-250}***(I)***** won\'t permit --** niem permitte {nyem
permIt}

***(You)***** won\'t permit --** nies permitte {nyes permIt}

***(He/she/it)***** won\'t permit --** niet permitte {nyet permIt}

***(We)***** won\'t permit --** niem(o)s permitte {nyEm(o)s permIt}

***(You)***** won\'t permit --** yu niete permitte {yu nyet permIt}

***(They)***** won\'t permit --** nient permitte {nyent permIt}

And to make it clear:

permittsiem = siem permitte

\[...\]

niem permitte = ne permittsiem

\[...\]

### []{#anchor-251}THE NEAR FUTURE

For an event that is close to occur, we use the auxiliar vah-. It works
in the following way: we add to this auxiliary the appropriate
conjugation of the present, and then we put the verb in the infinitive.
I am going to use the verb "orbat" (to work) in this example.

[]{#anchor-252}***(I)***** am **[]{#anchor-253}**going to work --** vahm
orbate {va:m orbAt}

***(You)***** are going to work --** vahs orbate {va:s orbAt}

***(He/she/it)***** going to work --** vaht orbate {va:t orbAt}

***(We)***** are going to work --** vahmos orbate {vA:mos orbAt}

***(You)***** are going to work --** yu vahte orbate {yu va:t orbAt}

***(They)***** are going to work --** vahnt orbate {vA:nt orbAt}

[]{#anchor-254}FUTURE PERFECT
-----------------------------

They are future events, but that already occurred in the mentioned
facts. Look an example below:

**When I return, he will have already left --** Quando reicsiem, is
habsiet ja likwn

Very similar to English.

[]{#anchor-255}SUBJUNCTIVE
--------------------------

It indicates desire or expectancy.

Only the verb "es" has the complete conjugation in this mode.

**Io sia {yo sya} --** []{#anchor-256}*(that I)* be

**Sias {syas} --** *(that you)* be

**Is/Ia/Id sia {is/ya/id sya} --** *(that he/she/it)* be

**Siam(o)s {syAm(o)s} --** *(that we)* be

**Siate {syat} --** *(that you)* be

**Siant {syant} --** *(that they)* be

All the other verbs only have the singular. The endings are:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-257}**person singular:** -a

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -as

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -a

Per this ending you can make a negative imperative with the prohibitive
adverb "mae" {may}.

**Mae kaupas {may kAopas} --** "Don't buy!" or "Thou shalt not buy!

[]{#anchor-258}IMPERATIVE
-------------------------

It indicates an order or an ask.

The conjugation of the main verbs:

**Sdi {sdi} --** []{#anchor-259}be

**Estu {Estu} --** *(he/she/it)* be

**Smad ses {smad ses} --** let\'s be

**Ste {ste} --** be

**Sontu {sOntu} --** *(they)* be

**Hab(e) {hab} --** have

**Smad hab(e) {smad hab} --** let\'s have

**Habte {habt} --** have

**Woid(e) {woyd} --** know

**Smad woide {smad woyd} --** let\'s know

**Woidte {woydt} --** know

The imperative of the 2^nd^ person singular corresponds to the verbal
stem, with or without the final -e.

**Leave! --** linekw! {lInëkw} ou linkwe! {linkw}

**Eat this food --** edd tod anon {ed tod anOn}

In the 1^st^ person plural it\'s used the word "smad" *(let\'s)* with
the verb in the infinitive.

**Smad linkwes {smad lInkwës} --** let\'s leave

**Smad edde {smad ed} --** let\'s eat

In the 2^nd^ person plural, the form is the same used in the simple
present, but without the personal pronoun.

**Linkwte {lInkut} --** *(you)* leave

**Eddte {edt} -** []{#anchor-260}(*you)* eat

[]{#anchor-261}CONDITIONAL
--------------------------

**Esiem {ezyEm} --** []{#anchor-262}*(I)* would be

**Esies {ezyEs} --** *(you)* would be

**Esiet {ezyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* would be

**Esiem(o)s {ezyEm(o)s} --** *(we)* would be

**Yu esiete {yu ezyEt} --** *(you)* would be

**Esient {ezyEnt} --** *(they)* would be

**Habiem {habyEm} --** []{#anchor-263}*(I)* would have

**Habies {habyEs} --** *(you)* would have

**Habiet {habyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* would have

**Habiem(o)s {habyEm(o)s} --** *(we)* would have

**Yu habiete {yu habyEt} --** *(you)* would have

**Habient {habyEnt} --** *(they)* would have

**Woidiem {woydyEm} --** []{#anchor-264}*(I)* would know

**Woidies {woydyEs} --** *(you)* would know

**Woidiet {woydyEt} --** *(he/she/it)* would know

**Woidiem(o)s {woydyEm(o)s} --** *(we)* would know

**Yu woidiete {woydyEt} --** *(you)* would know

**Woidient {woydyEnt} --** *(they)* would know

This verbal mood is made attaching the verbal stem + "ie" + conjugation
of the present.

[]{#anchor-265}***(I)***** would eat --** eddiem {edyEm}

***(You)***** would eat --** eddies {edyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** would eat --** eddiet {edyEt}

***(We)***** would eat --** eddiemos {edyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** would eat --** yu eddiete {yu edyEt}

***(They)***** would eat --** eddient {edyEnt}

There is no problem if the verb ends in -ye:

**Sudye {sUdy(ë)} (to sue) →** sudyiet {sudyEt} (*he/she/it* would sue)

### []{#anchor-266}BUT WHAT ABOUT VERBS THAT ALREADY FINISH WITH "IE"?

Regarding these ones, replace "ie" for "icie". Let\'s see the verb
"edifie" {edIfye}, which means "to edify".

[]{#anchor-267}***(I)***** would edify --** edificiem {edifitsyEm}

***(You)***** would edify --** edificies {edifitsyEs}

***(He/she/it)***** would edify --** edificiet {edifitsyEt}

***(We)***** would edify --** edificiemos {edifitsyEm(o)s}

***(You)***** would edify --** yu edificiete {yu edifitsyEt}

***(They)***** would edify --** edificient {edifitsyEnt}

### []{#anchor-268}PAST CONDITIONAL TO EXPRESS A "FUTURE OF THE PAST"

It's made with the verb in the conditional with the prefix ee-.

Is eet suaenokw ed bolt, ed okwivid-ye ne kwecto eegerasciet meis oku
quem sien pater

He was handsome and valiant, and showed no sign of ageing more swiftly
than his father

It ens Angmars malefic waldh, ed it Earnur, Gondors Korion, sib attraxit
id implacable haines ios Roybrukh, bet pelu yars eedehnient pre to buit
revelet

So ended the evil realm of Angmar; and so did Eärnur, Captain of Gondor,
earn the chief hatred of the Witch-king; but many years were still to
pass before that was revealed

[]{#anchor-269}CATEGORIES OF VERBAL STEMS
-----------------------------------------

Depending on the kind of verb, the stem may suffer changes, all of them
will be explained in this subchapter. Although I will talk a lot here
about participles, you don\'t need to worry about them, it\'s still not
necessary to know how create them, it\'s enough to know that they are
nominal forms of the verb *(like the past passive participle "eaten"
that comes from the verb "to eat")*.

### []{#anchor-270}NASAL INFIXES

From here to the final of this subchapter of **NASAL INFIXES**, the text
will be almost a transcription of the book *The Grammar Of
Sambahsa-Mundialect In English*, of Dr. Olivier Simon. But I took many
information from the text *"Sambahsa in Six Minutes \#1 : Nasal
Infixes"* by Robert Winter.

Verbs with nasal infixes are those with the following characteristics:

-   There is an unstressed "e" as last vowel and this "e"
-   This "e" is accompanied by the consonant "m" or "n". Here are the
    possible configurations:

    \_\_\_\_-en

    \_\_\_\_-en-

    \_\_\_\_-em

    \_\_\_\_-em-

    \_\_\_\_ne-

    \_\_\_\_-ne-

    \_\_\_\_me-

    \_\_\_\_-me-

-   This "e" precedes or follows an infix

Be careful to not fall into the trap of putting all verbs with "em" or
"en" in this category. For example, the verb "preven" ("to prevent") has
no nasal infix because the stressed syllable is exactly in "en",
{prëvEn}.

Let\'s work with the following words:

**Linekw {lInëkw} --** to leave

[]{#anchor-271}**Pressem {prEsëm} --** to press

[]{#anchor-272}**Scinesd {sInësd} --** to split *(transitive verb)*

[]{#anchor-273}**Annem {Anëm} --** to breathe

[]{#anchor-274}**Pregen {prEdjën} --** to imbue, to impregnate

In the present tense, and in all the tenses derived from the present
tense, the verbs lose their unstressed "e" when possible. If, with the
deletion of the "e", an "s" or "ss" join to a consonant, they are
deleted too. Let\'s see the result of this:

Linkwo, linkws, linkwt, linkwm(o)s,yu linkwte, linkwnt {lInkunt}

Premo, prems, premt, premmos, yu premte, preme(nt)

Scindo, scinds, scindt, scindmos, yu scindte, scinde(nt)

Annmo, annems, annemt, annmmos, yu annemt, annment

("annmt" and "annms" would be unpronounceable)

Pregno {prEnyo}, pregens {prEdjëns}, pregent, pregnems {prEnyëms}, yu
pregent, pregne(nt)

All the verbs, with or without nasal infix, an "e" can be put between
the verbal stem and the conjugation for the word being pronounceable.
Look at this case with the verb "storgn".

Storgno, storgnes, storgnet, storgnems, yu storgnet, storgne(nt)

Verbs that have an unstressed "e" at the end are conjugated in the
following way:

Io entre, entres, entret, entrems, yu entret, entre(nt)

Yes, it\'s this what you\'ve seen, the verb doesn\'t is conjugated in
the 1^st^ person singular, that\'s why is compulsory the use of the
pronoun "io".

Verbs whose last vowel is unstressed and is before a consonant follow
the same pattern:

Io hinder, hinders, hindert, hinderms, yu hindert, hindernt

It\'s "hinder" but not "hindere" because "hindere" would change the
accentuation {hindEr}

In the past tense and its derivatives, the verb, besides the lose of the
unstressed "e", loses the nasal infix.

**Linekw --** likwim, likwist, likwit, likwam, likwat, likweer

**Pressem --** pressim, pressist, pressit, pressam, pressat, presseer

**Annem -- **annim, annist, annit, annam, annat, anneer

### []{#anchor-275}VERBS WITH "EH" + CONSONANT

In verbs with a vowel "eh" *followed by a consonant*, the "eh" becomes
"oh" when in the past tense and past participle.

**Ghehd --** to be able to, can

**Present:** ghehdo, ghehds, ghehdt, ghehdmos, yu ghehdte, ghehde(nt)

**Infinitive:** ghehde

**Past tense:** io ghohd, tu ghohd...

**Or:** ghohdim, ghohdist/ghohdst(a), ghohdit, ghohdam, ghohdat,
ghohdeer

**Past participle:** ghohdt / ghohden

### []{#anchor-276}VERBS WITH "EU" AND "EI"

Verbs with "eu" or "ei", within the word, have these parts respectively
replaced by "i" and "u" when used in the infinitive, past tense or past
participle.

**Kheiss --** to feel

**Present:** kheisso, tu kheiss, kheisst, kheissmos, yu kheisste,
kheisse(nt)

"tu" is compulsory before "kheiss" because its ending cannot be listened

**Infinitive:** khisses {qIsës}

**Past tense:** io khiss, tu khiss...

**Or:** khissim, khisst(a) / khissist, khissit, khissam, khissat,
khisseer

**Past participle:** khisst / khissen

**Beud --** to appeal to, to make (someone) pay attention (to = dat.),
to demand (something)

**Present:** beudo, beuds, beudt, beudmos, yu beudte, beude(nt)

**Infinitive:** budes {büdz}

**Past tense:** io bud, tu bud...

**Or:** budim, budst(a) / budist, budit, budam, budat, budeer

**Past participle:** budt / buden

**Credeih --** to believe

**Present:** credeihm, credeihs, credeiht, credeihm(o)s, yu credeihte,
credeihnt

**Infinitive:** credihes {krëdI:s}

**Past tense:** io credih, tu credih...

**Or:** credihsim, credihst(a), credihsit, credihsam, credihsat, credihr

**Past participle:** crediht / credihn

### []{#anchor-277}VERBS WITH "A"

Verbs with "a" within the word, even the diphthongs "au" or "ay", have
their "a" replaced for "ie" in the past tense, but the "a" is maintained
in the past participle. Despite this rule, the apophony may be ignored
for the verbs with "a", "au" and "ay" in the past tense conjugation.

**nak --** to reach

**Present:** nako, nacs, nact, nakmos, yu nacte, nake(nt)

**Infinitive:** nake

**Past tense:** io niek, tu niek...

**Or:** niekim, niecst(a)/niekist, niekit, niekam, niekat, niekeer

Nakim, nacsta... are possible, but actually they are not used.

**Past participle:** nact / naken

**sayg --** to say

**Present:** saygo, saycs, sayct, saygmos, yu saycte, sayge(nt)

**Infinitive:** sayge

**Past tense:** io sieyg, tu sieycst...

**Or:** sieygim, sieycst(a)/sieygist, sieygit, sieygam, sieygat,
sieygeer

"Sieygim" almost is not used.

**Past participle:** sayct / saygen

**aur --** to hear

**Present:** auro, aurs, aurt, aurm(o)s, yu aurte, aurnt

**Infinitive:** aure

**Past tense:** io ieur, tu ieurst...

**Or:** ieurim, ieurst(a)/ieurist, ieurit, ieuram, ieurat, ieureer

**Past participle:** aurt / aur(e)n

### []{#anchor-278}THE VON WAHL RULES

The ending of these verbs are modified in the past tense and past
participle:

  ----------------- --------------------
  Original          After modification
  -d                -s
  -dd / -tt         -ss
  -rt / -rr / -rg   -rs
  -lg               -ls
  -ct               -x
  ----------------- --------------------

Verbs ending in -v follow the same procedure of -t, but only for their
past participle. If the -v comes after "o" or "u", it falls, otherwise,
it will be replaced for -w.

**Solv --** solwt

**Lav --** lawt

In other forms the -v disappears.

**mov -- **mot

**Clud --** to close

**Present:** cludo, cluds, cludt, cludmos, yu cludte, clude(nt)

**Infinitive:** clude

**Past tense:** io clus, tu clusst...

**Or:** clusim, clusst(a)/clusist, clusit, clusam, clusat, cluseer

**Past participle:** clus / cluden

**Sedd --** to sit

**Present:** seddo, sedds, seddt, seddmos, yu seddte, sedde(nt)

**Infinitive:** sedde

**Past tense**: io sess, tu sesst...

**Or:** sessim, sesst(a)/sessist, sessit, sessam, sessat, sesseer

**Past participle:** sess / sedden

**Permitt --** to allow

**Present:** permitto, permitts, permitt, permittmos, yu permitte,
permitte(nt)

**Infinitive:** permitte

**Past tense:** io permiss, tu permisst...

**Or:** permissim, permisst(a)/permissist, permissit, permissam,
permissat, permisseer

**Past participle:** permiss / permitten

**Volg --** to turn (oneself)

**Present:** volgo, volcs, volct, volgmos, yu volcte, volge(nt)

**Infinitive:** volge

**Past tense: **io vols, tu volsst...

**Or:** volsim, volsst(a)/volsist, volsit, volsam, volsat, volseer

**Past participle:** vols / volgen

**Curr --** to run

**Present:** curro, currs, currt, currm(o)s, yu currte, curre(nt)

**Infinitive:** curre

**Past tense:** io curs, tu curst...

***Or:** cursim, curst(a)/cursist, cursit, cursam, cursat, curseer*

**Past participle:** curs / curren

### []{#anchor-279}ENDING WITH A STRESSED VOWEL

Verbs ending with a stressed vowel, or with a -h just after the vowel,
follow the pattern below:

**Gwah --** to go to

**Present:** gwahm, gwahs, gwaht, gwahm(o)s, yu gwahte, gwahnt

**Infinitive:** gwahe

**Past tense:** gwahsim, gwahst(a)/gwahsist, gwahsit, gwahsam, gwahsat,
gwahr

**Past participle:** gwaht / gwahn

### []{#anchor-280}THE OTHER VERBS

They follow the rules normally and request the conjugation in the past
tense.

**Duc --** to lead

**Present:** duco, ducs, duct, ducmos, yu ducte, ducent

**Infinitive: **duce {düts}

**Past tense:** duxim, ducst(a)/duxist, duxit, duxam, duxat, duxeer

You may say "ducim", "ducit"... too. "duxim" was chosen here for
etimological reasons, because Latin have dux- as the past of duc-.

**Past participle: **[]{#anchor-281}duct / ducen

The accentuation must stay in the same syllable for all persons in the
present tense.

In all the verbal moods, except the nasal infixes, the unstressed "e"
between two consonants, when this range is at the end of the word, can
be dropped if the junction of these two consonants doesn\'t change the
pronunciation of the first consonant.

For ending this section with a golden key, I bring the conjugation of
more two verbs that may look complicated for some people:

**Peries --** to surpass

**Present:** perieso, (tu) peries, periest, periesmos, yu perieste,
periesent

**Future:** periessiem, periessies, periessiet, periessiem(o)s, yu
periessiete, periessient

**Conditional:** periesiem, periesies, periesiet, periesiem(o)s, yu
periesiete, periesient

**Infinitive:** periese

**Past tense:** periesim, periesist, periesit, periesam, periesat,
perieseer

**Past participle:** periest / periesen

**Smauter --** to watch

**Present:** io smauter, smauters, smautert, smauterms, yu smautert,
smaunternt

**Conditional:** smauteriem, smauteries, etc..

**Infinitive:** smauter

**Past tense:** io smieuter, tu smieuterst, is/ia/id smieuter....

**Or:** smieutrim, smieuterst/smieutrist, smieutrit, smieut(e)ram,
smieut(e)rat, smieut(e)reer

**It's also possible to use the form without ablaut:** smautrim,
smauterst/smautrist, smautrit...

**Past participle:** smautert / smautern

[]{#anchor-282}VERBAL AFFIXES
-----------------------------

In the examples below I will use words in the gerund and I will make use
of reflexive pronouns, don\'t worry about them, only focus on the verbal
affix and how they change the verbs. Later I will talk about gerund and
reflexive pronouns.

**bi- --** to begin to *(*[]{#anchor-283}*inchoative)*

**Id luce biattract insects --** The light begins to attract insects

**na- --** to keep on + *gerund (continuative)*

**Is nieudh urgent-ye namove --** He needed urgently to keep moving

**re- --** *as the re- of English*

**Ho tohrben rescribe mien buk --** I have had to rewrite my book

**vi- --** *corresponds to the English adverb "finally"*

**Is viemers ex id wed --** He finally emerged out of the water

**za- --** to stop doing

**Ibs sclavs buit permitten za-ermes --** The slaves were allowed to
stop rowing

### []{#anchor-284}AFFIXES THAT CHANGE THE TENSE OF THE VERB

**ee- --** used to

**Hermann ee(-)gwaht id scol siens urb --** Hermann used to go to the
school of his town

**Ia ee(-)lyeict flors ep id tumbh sienias mater --** She used to lay
down flowers on her mother\'s grave

**Io eeorbato cer --** I used to work there

*Notice that the verbs are in the present tense*

**sa(l)- --** to be about to *+ verb* *(always written with hyphen)*

**Is wir sa-khierk --** The man was about to drown

**-skw --** to intend to do, to like to *(desiderative)* *(may be added
to verbs if it doesn\'t modify the accentuation of the verb)*

**Ies nauts gwahskweer id maykhana --** The sailors wanted to go to the
inn

**-eih --** *factive*

**Kaupeihm iom tod wogh --** I make him buy this car

Verbs ended in "ie" have this part replaced by "iceih". Stems in "ei"
change this part for "i" because of euphonic reasons.

Pay attention that no all verb ended in "eih" is a factive, "credeih"
and "vergeih" are two examples.

This affix can be added to adjectives. "rudh" means "red", "rudheih"
means "make (something) red".

[]{#anchor-285}SOME LITERARY VERBAL FORMS
-----------------------------------------

Due to its Indo-European heritage, Sambahsa has some verbal forms that
are found only in literary use.

### []{#anchor-286}OPTIONAL ENDINGS OF THE PRESENT OF THE INDICATIVE

If it is compatible with the accentuation, the verbs can receive the
following terminations:

**1**^**st**^** **[]{#anchor-287}**person singular:** -mi

**2**^**nd**^** person singular:** -si

**3**^**rd**^** person singular:** -ti

**3**^**rd**^** person plural:** -nti

**The verb "ses":** esmi, essi, esti, sonti

[]{#anchor-288}[]{#anchor-289}**Stahnti medsu iens peinds --** here,
they stand amidst the enemies

**Acquiseihmi denars kay likes videoleiks --** I gain money for playing
video-games

There is not much to explain about this form, it is like a euphonic
vocalization, but for the conjugation of the present.

### []{#anchor-290}OLD FORMS OF THE IMPERATIVE

In the 2^nd^ person singular of the imperative, an option may be the use
of the suffix ‑di to the stem of the verb. Don\'t forget in changing
"eu" and "ei" for respectively "u" and "i" and observe the nasal infix.

**Kludi! --** listen! *instead* "kleu(e)!"

**Ihdi! --** go! *instead* "eih(e)!"

An imperative in the 3^rd^ persons is possible by suffixing the -u to
the conjugated verb, if it doesn\'t change the accentuation.

**Is maurdher nehct --** the murderer perishes

**Is maurdher nehctu! --** let the murderer perish!

**I slougs behrnt gwaur bermens --** the servants carry heavy burdens

**I slougs behrntu gwaur bermens! --** let the servants carry heavy
burdens!

It\'s possible to use the stem of the verb with the ending -e and a
subject in the sentence:

**Gwive is roy! --** long live the king!

### []{#anchor-291}PARTICIPLE IN THE FUTURE

To make the participle, it\'s used the synthetic form of the future plus
the ending ‑nd.

**gwehmsie + nd = **[]{#anchor-292}**gwehmsiend --**
[]{#anchor-293}*what or who* will be coming

The near future is marked with the ending "tur", for making it:

-   Add -ur to the verbs in participle that follow the Von Wahl rules,
    or those ones that end with "v".

**Cedd --** cessur (going to yield)

**Emov --** emotur (going to emote)

-   Add -ur to the 3^rd^ person singular in the present.

**Baht --** bahtur (going to speak)

The active future of the verb "ses" is "butur".

**Dat tod strehl khact esus xuden in vain, Ashvatthâman diswehrt id kyi
embryos qui ias esors iom Pândavas behrnt we behrsient in ir gwelbhs,
quibs is addeiht iom gnahtur napter Arjunas --** As this shaft cannot
have been smitten in vain, Ashvatthâman diverts it towards the embryos
that the wives of the Pândavas are bearing or will bear in their wombs,
to whom he adds Arjuna\'s grandson yet to be born

"gnahtur" comes from "gnah".

### []{#anchor-294}THE OLD FORMATIONS OF THE INFINITIVE

Formations of the old infinitive are possible in two ways: following the
same base of the active future seen before (the use of the passive
participle in "t" or of the 3^rd^ person singular of the present), if it
doesn\'t modify the accentuation.

The first formation ends with -(t) and expresses the idea of a proposal.

**Abgwahsit pinctum in id widu --** He goes off to paint in the
timberland

**Gwehmo essum con vos --** I come to eat with you

Noun verbs.

**Deictum exact reuls sienims almens --** Showing exact rules to one's
pupils

**sienims =** "sien" + dative plural "ims"

The other endings end with -tu and may be translated as "to be ...-ed".
It appears often after qualitative adjectives.

**Un garden amat spehctu --** A garden *(that is)* pleasant to be looked
at

Sometimes it appears as an adjective of obligation.

**Ia kwehrtu opsa** -- The tasks to be done

### []{#anchor-295}THE DURATIVE

The durative suffix -neu corresponds to actions that started in the past
and continue until the present, it includes situations where normally it
would be used words like "since" or "for".

**Stahneum her pon trigim minutes --** I've been standing here for
thirty minutes

The past tense is made with ee-.

**Eestahneum her pon trigim minutes --** I had been standing there for
30 minutes

**Eeghangneut apter iom pon Orleans --** He had been walking behind him
since Orleans

### []{#anchor-296}THE EVENTIVE

It means "not to stop doing", it consists in repeat the fist consonant
(or sC, Cw, Cy or Cv) before the stem with the addiction of i- or ei-.
The imperfect tense is made with ee-.

**Gainsbourg eedideumt ed vimohr ob cancer --** Gainsbourg didn\'t stop
/ was always smoking and finally died of cancer

"eedideumt" comes from "deum"

**Is giglect iam nieberin --** He doesn\'t stop ogling the female
neighbor

*"giglect" comes from "gleg"*

### []{#anchor-297}THE INTENSIVE

It means "to do little by little". It consists in the duplication of the
stem (with the deletion of occlusives in the middle). Rarely used. The
imperfect tense is made with ee-.

**Is leisleist "Alice in Daumsenland" aun eucus Sambahsa lakin speht is
visagvsiet tod bahsa --** He is reading little by little \"Alice in
Daumsenland\" without having learned Sambahsa and hopes however he will
finally know (how to speak) this language

### []{#anchor-298}THE ITERATIVE

It means "to start to keep on doing". There are apophonies to be
observed:

**eh:** oh

**ei:** oi

**eu:** ou

You use the suffix -ye. The imperfect tense is made with ee-.

**Quan is eewehght ex Paris do Varschava, is eestopt in Nürnberg dind
eekwohryet sien itner tiel Polska --** When he used to drive from Paris
to Warsaw, he would stop at Nuremberg and then continue his journey up
to Poland

[]{#anchor-299}**Kwehr- sien itner --** to make one\'s way

**Kwohrye- sien itner --** *it indicates that the action was stopped for
a time *(for example: for the agent get a rest)* and it continues this
action later. It wouldn\'t be like in "rekwehr- sien itner", which
indicates that all the action is being remade.*

**Pos neicus el moskitt, lyohgyim --** After having killed the mosquito,
I lay back on my bed

"lyohgyim" comes from "lyehg"

### []{#anchor-300}THE PERFECT

It represents an action made in the past whose effects or consequences
still influence in the present. It\'s made prefixing the first letter of
the stem followed by the "e" and then the verb conjugated in the past.

[]{#anchor-301}**Lelikwst id vetus wastu --** Thou hast left the old
city []{#anchor-302}*("lelikwst" comes from the verb "linekw")*

**Ia lelyigit flors ep id tumbh sienias mater --** She has been laying
down flowers on her mother\'s grave *(she does it until today, it's a
tradition now)*

It\'s very similar to the Present Perfect, the difference is that the
Perfect reinforces the idea that the consequences of the actions are
still there. This verbal form is very literal and can\'t work with all
the verbs.

[]{#anchor-303}ADVERBS
======================

Adverbs are words that qualify verbs and adjectives, like in "traveled
quietly" and "ate a lot", where the verbs "traveled" and "ate" are
qualified by the adverbs "quietly" and "a lot". For making an adverb you
have to add the suffix -ye (with hyphen!!!). Look at some examples:

**End --** end, final

**End-ye --** finally

**Enpace --** peaceful

**Enpace-ye --** peacefully

It's can be said that the -ye is like the -ly of English. But, as in
English, not all adverbs end with the same termination, because some
words are adverbs by themselves, look at some examples:

**Tik --** only

**Ops --** often

**Just --** just

***Ho just nicen un wir --** I've just killed a man*

**Just barwakt --** just in time

**It(han) {it / i§An} --** so, this way

**Bfuyi {bfUyi} --** forever

**Sigwra {sIgura} --** definitely, surely

**Oku {Oku} --** quickly

**Ja** **{ja} --** already

**Semper {sEmpër} --** always

**Tun {tun} --** then

**(Ya)schi {(yA)ci} --** too

Adverbs also can be made by adding the prefix a- to substantives.

**Part --** part

**Top(p) --** top

**Apart --** apart

**Atop --** atop

Adverbs of quality like "baygh" and "pior" may behave like adjectives
when they refer to a substantive, they may have (it's not compulsory) a
declensional final, but as an adverb (with the possible adjunction of
the -ye) when they refer to an attributive adjective.

**Piora kowpic chifans sont vierdnic pro sieune --** Too many copious
meals are harmful for health

**Pior-ye kowpic chifans sont vierdnic pro sieune --** Too much copious
meals are harmful for health

[]{#anchor-304}REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS AND THE POSSESSIVE PRONOUN "SIEN"
===================================================================

The pronouns are: "se" (accusative), "sib" (dative) and "sien"
(possessive pronoun).

**Se vidmos in id specule[^10] --** We see ourselves in the mirror

**"...", sib sieyg is lytil prince --** "...", said the little prince to
himself

The pronoun "sien" refers to the subject of the sentence, but never
appears together the nominal group of the subject.

**Un pater alt sien purts --** A father raises his children

**Julio ed eyso prient siefreer do Brasilu --** Julio and his friend
traveled to Brazil

Notice that it couldn't be "Julio ed sien prient", remember of what was
said before.

The "self" is translated as -swo, look:

**Gnohdi teswo --** Know thyself

Ah, it's opportune to say that "each other" is translated to "mutu" in
Sambahsa.

**Martin ed eyso prient tolke con mutu in Sambahsa --** Martin and his
friend talk to each other in Sambahsa

[]{#anchor-305}RELATIVE PRONOUN AND SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTION
=============================================================

Look the sentences below, look at the use of the word "that":

\(1) This is the horse *that* I bought

\(2) I had a daughter *that* wanted to be singer

\(3) I've said *that* I don't like coffee

\(4) He is so lazy *that* his parents put wheels in his bed

Although they are the same word, they have different functions.

The "that"s of the sentences (1) and (2) are relative pronouns because
they are related to some substantive used before, in the case of the
sentence (1) it\'s "horse" and in the sentence (2) it\'s "daughter".

The "that"s of the sentences (3) and (4) are subordinating conjunctions
because they start a new sentence.

You already know the relative pronouns, because they are in that list of
cases of declension, only pay attention about what case to use, because
the "that" of the sentence (1) is a direct object (of the verb "bought")
while the "that" of the sentence (2) is a subject.

**This is the horse *****that***** I bought -- **Tel est el cavall
*quel* kieupim

**I had a daughter *****that***** wanted to be singer --** Hiebim un
dugter *qua* iskwit ses sehngver

The subordinating conjunction is often translated as "od".

**I've said *****that***** I don't like coffee --** Ho saygen *od* ne
kamo cofie

**He thought *****that***** I am from Africa --** Is mohnit *od* som ex
Africa

As sometimes only a conjunction is not clear enough to indicate whether
what was said is a desire or a claim, there is also the subordinating
conjunction "ke" (or "kem"), which express a desire and may be used in
the place of "od".

**I desire that he learns Sambahsa --** Vanscho kem is euct Sambahsa

**That our team win the enemy team and become the European soccer
champion --** Ke nies swoin vinct id peindswoin ed biht Europes football
champion

**Let's fake that the glass have become so soft as gauze to we can go
the on the other side --** Smad simule kem id glas hat biht tem moll
quem kaz kay ghehdiemos lites ocolo

**I ask you to leave --** Te prehgo ke linkws

[]{#anchor-306}THE RELATIVE PRONOUNS "YO(S)", "YA" AND "YOD"
------------------------------------------------------------

I thought a lot if I really should bring this subject here, because, as
you'll see, maybe you will never use them, but as this is a *complete*
grammar, I felt in the obligation of explaining them.

Basically the relation is:

**Qui --** yo(s)

**Qua -- **ya

**Quod --** yod

The relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod exist to make independent sentences,
how? Look the example below:

**Latif, gwivt-yo in Afghanistan, baht Sambahsa --** Latif, who lives in
Afghanistan, speaks Sambahsa

They actually are enclitics, you\'ll know more about them in an
appropriate chapter, it\'s enough to know that they must be suffixed --
with a hyphen -- just after the verb.

Do you notice that even if we remove the excerpt "gwivt-yo in
Afghanistan", the sentence wouldn't lose its meaning, once "Latif baht
Sambahsa" still pass the same message? We can understand the relative
pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod insert information merely additional that --
grammatically speaking -- can be omitted.

Now let's see an example that the relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod
wouldn't be useful.

**Id bahsa, quod Latif baht, est Sambahsa --** the language, which Latif
speaks, is Sambahsa

If we remove the excerpt "quod Latif baht", the sentence would lose its
original meaning.

You would question me: "but I could use a lot these relative pronouns
that you say be rarely used because I make a lot of sentences where they
fit".

But you could use the pronouns qui/qua/quod in the place of yo(s)/ya/yod
like in: "Latif, qui gwivt in Afghanistan, baht Sambahsa"

The only reason to use the relative pronouns yo(s)/ya/yod would be for
literary proposals.

[]{#anchor-307}QUESTIONS
========================

There are diverse ways for making a question, the first one is by adding
the word "kwe" {kwe} at the beginning of the sentence.

**Kwe ghehdo ghende tod? --** Can I hold it?

**Kwe siem ghehdo ghende tod? --** Could I hold it?

**Kwe ter sont leuds her? --** Are there people here?

**Kwe sont leuds her? --** Are there people here?

The "kwe" also may be used at the end of a question together with the
"no" with the role of "isn't", "aren't", "wasn't", etc.

**Safersiemos do ia Uniet Stats, kwe no? --** We will travel to the
United States, wont?

You also can make a question inverting the position of the main verb.

**Ghehdo io ghende tod? --** Can I hold it?

**Siem io ghehde ghende tod? --** Can I hold it?

Notice that is necessary for the use of the pronoun.

**Sont ter leuds her? --** Are there people here?

Notice that is necessary the use of the "ter".

For questions with "what", "who", "when" and other similar pronouns, you
can just use the translations of these words.

**Quis ste yu? --** Who are you? *(question made for a male person)*

**Quando safersies --** When you travel?

[]{#anchor-308}NEGATION
=======================

To answer a question in a negative way, you can simply say "no".

**Gwivte yu in France? --** Do you live in France?

**No, ne gwivo in France, weiko in America --** no, I don't live in
France, I live in America

To create a negative verb, it's enough to put the "ne" before the verb.

**Ne eddo leckereits --** I don't eat candies

The "mae" {may} is a prohibitive.

**Mae eddo leckereits --** I shouldn't eat sweeties

**Mae eddas leckereits --** "don't eat sweeties" or "thou shalt not eat
sweeties" *(don't you understand the reason of the ending -as in the
verb "edd"? Remember the reason in the chapter about the subjunctive
verb)*

To facilitate, just remember those biblical commandments:

**Mae neicas --** You shall not murder

We may not forget the verb "khak" {qak}, the antonymous of "ghehd"..

**Khako kaupe un wogh --** I can't buy a car

[]{#anchor-309}ABOUT THE USE OF THE "SI"
----------------------------------------

In order to have not questions regarding the use of the "si", which
means "yes" and is used to answer negative questions. Observe the
following situation:

**Ne has tu purts? --** Don't you have children?

Si

Notice that "si" doesn't confirm the thought of who asks, in other
words.

**Ne has tu purts? --** Don't you have children?

**Si, ho purts --** Yes, I have children

[]{#anchor-310}AVOIDING REPETITIONS
===================================

In a conversation, the necessity of referring to a substantive already
used just before may occur. For avoiding the repetition of words,
Sambahsa offers basically the same resources as English. Look the
examples:

If you like tea, I can give you *some*

Sei tu kams chay, vahm tib schehnke *sem*

I bring the tea and its cups.

Please, give me *one*!

Bringho id chay ed ia tasses.

Plais, schehnk mi *uno*!

A course of faculty is composed of diverse subjects, and *each one* has
a certain quantity of hours

Un facultat curs est composen ab/med multa matiers, ed *ielg* hat un
certain quantitat om hors

Take your book and pass *mine*

Ghendte vies buk ed anancte mi *mieno*

You could say just "mien" or "id mien", but "mieno" makes the message
more clear

Which T-shirt are you going to use?

I am going to use *my newer one*

Qualg tischert vahte yu vehse?

Vahm vehse *mien nov(er)*

My little fish is like of the neighbor*'s one* before die

Mien lytil pisk est lik *tal* ios nieber pre mehre

Here the complete sentence: Mien lytil pisk est lik al pisk ios nieber
pre mehre

[]{#anchor-311}PARTICIPLES
==========================

Participles are the nominal form of the verb.

[]{#anchor-312}ACTIVE PRESENT
-----------------------------

For forming the active participle of the present, it's enough to add the
suffix ‑(e)nd *(‑(e)nt is possible too, but rarely used because it can
make confusion with the third person of the plural)*.

Using the verb "to be" plus the participle plus the active participle of
the present for making sentences like:

**Id sol eet bleigend --** The sun was shining

**Id bleigend sol --** The shining sun

**Es --** esend

**Hab --** Habend

**Woid --** woidend

In theory, the participles can be used as substantives, but actually, it
never occurs, what happens is the use of endings like ‑(e)nt and ‑(a)nt,
like in "president", "studyent" and "immigrant".

[]{#anchor-313}ACTIVE PAST
--------------------------

For forming the active participle of the past, it's enough to add the
suffix ‑us or ‑vs *(it'll depend of what gives the better pronunciation
to the word and of its accentuation patterns)*.

**Dank spollay ob gwehmus hetro --** Thank you very much for coming here

**Ia minst antslehnkus lands --** The less developed countries

**Es --** esus

**Hab --** Habus

**Woid --** woidus

[]{#anchor-314}PASSIVE PRESENT
------------------------------

From the passive participles, Sambahsa uses only the past, but it's
possible to use the passive present in composed words. The suffix is
‑men with the stem of the verb in the present.

**Al --** raise *(in the sense of raise a child)*

**Almen --** pupil

[]{#anchor-315}PASSIVE PAST
---------------------------

For forming the passive participle, it's enough to add the suffix ‑t or
‑(e)n. I judge this participle the better way and you'll understand why.

**Es --** est / esen *(been)*

**Hab --** habt / haben *(had)*

**Woid --** wois / woiden *(known)*

### []{#anchor-316}OTHER WAY OF EXPRESSING THE PAST TENSE, THE PRESENT PERFECT

It's the same as in English but Sambahsa tenses can refer to actions
that don\'t last anymore, even if they still have consequences.

**Ho edden / Ho ess[^11] --** I've eaten

**Ho kaupen / Ho kaupt --** I've bought

**Has liubhen / Has liubht --** You've loved

**Habte yu edden? / Habte yu ess? --** Have you eaten?

**Habte yu kaupen? / Habte yu kaupt? --** Have you bought?

### []{#anchor-317}A **MANNER** OF MAKING ADJECTIVES **THROUGH** VERBS

Let's use the following verbs and substantives in the examples:

**Sneigv {sneygv} --** snow

**Calive {kalIv} --** cabin

**Lyegher {lyEgër} --** layer

**Tenu {tEnu} --** thin

**Myehrs {mye:rs} -- **to forget

**Covehr {kovE:r} --** to cover

**Covohr {kovO:r} --** *verb "covehr" in the past. In the next chapter,
I'll explain why it occurs.*

Now let's see the application of the participles:

**Myohrsen land --** Forgotten land

**Uno sneigvcovohrn calive --** A snow-covered cabin

**Un calive covohrno med un tenu sneigvlyegher --** A cabin covered with
a thin snow-layer

[]{#anchor-318}DECLENSIONS IN PARTICIPLES
-----------------------------------------

This is possible, but do not forget that the stress should be respected.

**Som drahndos[^12] do id dom --** I\'m running into the house

**I gleihvsi smautrers --** The spectators who have laughed

**Ia gwen ho visu --** The woman that I have seen

[]{#anchor-319}GERUND
=====================

To make the gerund, the active participle is used plus the suffix -ye
(with a hyphen!) when it's used a verb that is not "es".

**I am eating... --** Som eddend...

**He ate the cake looking at me --** Is essit id torte spehcend-ye me

**They *****(women)***** died working --** Ias mohreer orbatend-ye

If I've written "Is essit id torte spehcend me" *(without the -ye in the
gerund)* it would mean that is the cake that is looking me, I hope that
with this example you've learned how to difference better the gerund of
the active participle in the present.

If it facilitates the understanding: the two examples above may be
translated like "he ate the cake *while* he looked at me" and "they died
*while* they are working".

[]{#anchor-320}CONJUNCTIONS AND OTHER INVARIABLE WORDS
======================================================

Both in this chapter an in the next one, the chapter about the
prepositions, I'll work in the following way: I'll show some direct
translations of the words, but in the examples I may translate these
invariable Sambahsa words from per words or expressions of the English
language that I didn't show in the direct translation. How? For example,
the translation of "schowi" is "therefore, consequently", but in the
examples I did not []{#anchor-321}exactly use this translation! I did it
deliberately with the goal of showing you that you have to learn the
idea behind the words, not merely their direct translations!

Don't be afraid with the size of this chapter, I only aimed to put *all*
the invariable words here, in order to this grammar be a good reference
material.

**Aiw(o) {Äw(o)} --** ever

***Ays kays eet id bellst quod is hieb aiwo vis --** Her hair was the
most beautiful he had ever seen*

***Est stragn od tod ilaj aiw hieb esen usen --** It\'s strange that
this *(medical)* treatment has ever been used*

As substantive, "aiwo" means "age", i.e. "period of time, History", like
in "Petraiwo", which means "Stone Age".

***Id memorandum comprindt oino iom meist exhaustive playcts aiwo signen
ab bo lands, markend uno major wehnd in ira relations --** The
memorandum comprises one of the most exhaustive agreements ever signed
by both countries, highlighting a major turning point in their
relations*

**Agar {agAr} --** if, in case

***In 2005, id Chinese Parlament hat widen un "anti-secession" leg

2005, the Chinese Parliament passed an "anti-secession" act which
authorizes the use of force in case that Taiwan would declare its
independence*

**Api {Api} --** but, now *(to introduce a counter-argument)*

ad piskes, api leuds ne hant access ei fluv --** It is said that
fish(es) cannot be given to people, they must be taught how to fish, but
people don\'t have any access to the river*

***Gulf lands eiskwnt conserve ir teutisk ed religieus traditions. Api,

[]{#anchor-323}SOME **QUESTIONS** THAT CAN APPEAR
-------------------------------------------------

I\'ve tried to explain the conjunctions well in the examples, I\'ve even
used very similar examples to evidence the differences, but some doubts
can remain. In this subchapter, I try to predict some of them and I try
to answer them.

### []{#anchor-324}WHAT\'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "BET" AND "MEN"?

While "bet", the most common, presents a real opposition, "men" doesn\'t
present real opposition. Look the examples below:

**(1) Ne eddo **[]{#anchor-325}**leckereits, MEN ne som diabetic --** I
don\'t eat candies, but I am not diabetic

**(2) Ia orbat in un kiekwrschop, MEN ia ne est veterinar --** She works
in a pet shop, but she is not a veterinarian

**(3) Kamo sports, BET ne som un athlete --** I like sports, but I am
not an athlete

**(4) Gwivs in id eust, BET eiskws gwive in id west --** You live in the
east, but you want to live in the west

Observe that, in (1), if I don\'t eat candies, it doesn\'t necessarily
mean that I am diabetic; in (2) the woman works in a pet shop, but she
doesn\'t have to be veterinarian to work there. But in (3), if I say
that I like sports, many people may presume that I am an athlete; in (4)
the person lives in the east, so it\'s assumed that he/she wanted to
live there, but in reality his/her desire is other.

Don\'t worry so much, because the chose between "men" and "bet" is very
*subjective*, some can say that if you work in a pet shop, much probably
you are a veterinarian, thus we should use "bet" instead "men" in (2).
In (3), if you live in a place where people like sports a lot, but it\'s
common that almost no one practices such activities, "men" can be used.

### []{#anchor-326}WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "KA" AND "KAM"?

The conjunction "ka" refers to quality while "kam" refers to identity.

Ka Brasileir, Henrique hat portughesche ka materbahsa

As Brazilian, Henrique has Portuguese as mother tongue

Kam Olivier, Henrique baht Sambahsa

As Olivier, Henrique speaks Sambahsa

[]{#anchor-327}PREPOSITIONS
===========================

Most of the Sambahsa prepositions can be used as conjunctions too. They

Look the difference between "ex" and "exo"

When is not possible to express the idea of "made of" or "from certain
place", the preposition "ex" passes the idea of movement.

**Ghehdo bahe in dwodem bahsas --** I can speak in twelve languages

**Kye {kye} --** in the direction of. *This preposition merges itself
with the following determinat or the pronoun in the 3*^*rd*^* person,

**Vahm gwahe kye mien dom --** I shall go soon in the direction of my
house

**To ne est bad perfection, sontern to est un itner kye --** this is not

couldn\'t help herself from laughing in the middle of her tears

***Arriveer bad in vid unios mier menegh medsu quod is Lion ed is
Unicorn eent katuend --** They eventually arrived in sight of a big
crowd in the middle of which the Lion and the Unicorn were fighting*

moment --** Despite her situation, Sophi feared more for him than for
herself at this moment*

written as "oys".*

***Tuntos, ad pelu Stats ois id decolonisation moliet trehve ir tula
--** From this time, many States born out of the decolonization had
difficulties to find their balance*

I think that is better I explain what "ad" is doing in "ad pelu Stats"
for those who didn\'t understand. In the example was used the verb
"molie", which means "to be difficult to", that\'s why was necessary the
use of "ad" for indicating the indirect object. The real subject of
"moliet" is "trehve".

**Pati {pAti} --** including

[]{#anchor-328}SOME **QUESTIONS** THAT **MAY** APPEAR
-----------------------------------------------------

I\'ve tried to explain the prepositions well in the examples, I\'ve even
used very similar examples to evidence the differences, but some doubts
can remain. In this subchapter, I try to predict some of them and I try
to answer them.

### []{#anchor-329}DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "MED" AND "PER"

What\'s the difference between the two sentences below?

**Is magician hat construgen un castell med sien magia --** The magician
has built a castle with his magic

**Is magician hat construgen un castell per sien magia -- **The magician
has built a castle through his magic

The second sentence is grammatically correct, but it gives the
impression that the magician has built the castle with him in another
dimension or distant place, while in the first sentence the magician has
built the castle in the place where he was. Look whether with the
example below you can understand:

Glego per id fenster med mien durbin iam bikini-vehsend gwenak

I ogle through the window with my binoculars the bikini-weared young
woman

Did you notice why my second example *(the one about the magician who
has built the castle "per" his magic)* was strange?

### []{#anchor-330}DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "POS" AND "TRANS"

"Pos" is initially an adverb, in other words, if you say a sentence like
the one below:

**Id urb est pos id forest --** the city is after the forest

The sentence above means something like: first, it\'s necessary to cross
the forest before reaching the city.

### []{#anchor-331}DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "EX" AND "UD"

Let\'s see three examples:

**Som ex ia Uniet Stats --** I am from the United States

***Un helm ex stal --** A helmet of steel*

***Un brev ud ****Hilda**** --** a letter from Hilda*

The "ex", when not in the sense of "out", is used for something made
from the mentioned object or came from it, like a helmet of steel or a
person from a country. The "ud" is used for things that didn\'t come
from within the mentioned object, like we don\'t expect that the letter
was made from the body of Hilda, so we use "ud" instead "ex".

### []{#anchor-332}DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "VICE" AND "INSTET"

As prepositions both mean the same thing, but "instet" can be also an
adverb while "vice" also can be a prefix, like in "vice-president".

Henrique ne hat ghohden dake ia buks. *Instet*, Olivier hat ei yist ia
odt-documents

Henrique ne hat ghohden dake ia buks. *Vice to*, Olivier hat ei yist ia
odt-documents

[]{#anchor-334}ENCLITICS AND PROCLITICS
=======================================

Some of these words are not easy to be translated. Enclitics are words
put after another word while proclitics are words put before another
word.

The enclitic "tun" is the demonstrative of "kun" or "quando".

**Herodotos extendt tod nam do id continental hinterland, beuwend it
Asia id trit part ios gnoht mundios tun --** Herodot extends this name
to the continental hinterland, making thus of Asia the third part of the
known world then* (at that time)*

**Id Occidental nam ios land gwehmt sigwra ex id Medieval Chinese
pronunciation tom khanjis, quod tun buit launto do id bahsa Indonesias
ka "Jepang", ed dind ab Portughesche nauts --** the Occidental name of
the country surely comes from the Medieval Chinese pronunciation of
those hanzis, which was then borrowed into Indonesian as "Jepang", and
afterward by Portuguese sailors

When you have to use some clitic, but you haven't a word with the
convenient accentuation that supports the clitic, you can use "nu" as a
support, like in "nughi" *(nu + ghi)* or with the relative pronouns
"yos", "ya", "yod", "yel" *(for example: nu- yos, nu-yel)*.

**Chanda ex Zambia, nu-yos suabaht Sambahsa, gnoht maung bahsas --**
Chanda from Zambia, who speaks well Sambahsa, knows many languages

"ge" and "tar" are like "ghi", but as, sometimes, the repetition of the
particle "ghi" occurs very repeatedly, it\'s used these two particles.
"ge" emphasizes personal pronouns and articles, while "tar" emphasizes
interrogative pronouns.

**Ia gehnsiet un son, ed ei dahsies id nam Jesus; is ge salvsiet sien
popule ex idsa synts --** she will conceive a son, whom she will give
the name Jesus; it's him who will save his people from its sins

**Yed, isge ieg kam weysmee --** however, he did like we (did)

-ge is connected to a personal pronoun, in this sentence of the example
-ge is here to emphasize the opposition with "wey-smee"

**Quod tar tengicit is? --** what did he (really) look like?

Often "tar" and "ge" are not directly translated to another language,
especially "tar"

An excellent example with "nu" and "tar":

**Sei nu id luce quod est in te est temos, kam tar megil sessiet tod
temos! --** if, therefore, the light that is in thee be darkness, how
great is that darkness!

The enclitic "pet" reinforces identity, often translated as our "very".

**Henrique weict in idpet centre ios citad --** Henrique lives in the
very center of the city

To write "...in idswo centre..." would be strange because it means "...
in the center itself ..."

**Id brev hieb gwohmt unte idpet dwer ios laboratorium --** the letter
had come through the very door of the laboratory

**Est un prientlik geront quospet ghalv buit trohven medsu eys bustan
--** it\'s a friendly old man whose very skull was found in the middle
of his garden

**I reuschus leuds eent ipet parents ias magv --** the people who had
rushed were *(precisely)* the parents of the child *(after that child
had an accident)*

*ipet = i *(the []{#anchor-335}definite article)* + pet*

When "pet" is used after a verb, it has the sense of "to be in the
capacity of".

**Sei yu plais steighte con me do mien fiaker, duco-pet vos ad eys
baytel --** if you accept to get in with me into my cab, I *(can)* drive
you to his home

With adverbs of time and space, the word "kye", as an enclitic,
reinforces the adverb.

**... ed terkye id sinister masse uns bina forstilb ids ghebel uper id
strad --** ... and just at that point, a certain sinister block of
building thrust forward its gable on the street

**Ed mehnte ghi od is nos duxit tei stet querkye staht id dwer?! --**
and where do you think he carried us but to that place with the door?!

**"Nunkye", bahsit alter, antwehrdte mi: "quois gnohte yu me?" --** "And
now", said the other, you answer me: "how did you know me?"

Notice that "antwehrdte" and "gnohte yu" refer to one person, not to a
group as it may look at a first moment. It\'s because it\'s used the
pronoun of courtesy "yu", indeed you only can know it by the context.

**Tunkye eet circum nev saat ios aghyern, ed id prest nebule ios saison
--** it was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of
the season

**Gheskye ia ne eevevis iom pon quasi dwo munts --** it was nearly two
months since she had seen him till yesterday

The enclitic "wert" indicates reported speech.

**Sambahsa estwert baygh interessant --** Sambahsa - it is said - is
very interesting

**Sekwent qui ghieng pri iens unte ir mingo promenades, bowert sieyg
neid --** it was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday
walks, that they said nothing

**Sekwent tom mertikwol, ia bent comwert hieb haben meis dekhschat quem
gvol --** well, the child was not much the worse, more frightened,
according to the Sawbones

**Iswert liek stets meis confinit-se in id practis uper id laboratorium,
quer is hatta swohp yando --** the doctor, it appeared, now more than
ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he would
sometimes even sleep *(in the preceding sentence of the translation,
what we know about the doctor is reported by his butler)*

The proclitic "proe" is often translated as "already".

**Kun id nam os Hyde buit swohrt, Ustad Utterson proe-akowsicit, bet kun
is chohx id klor, is khiek etidwoie --** when Hyde\'s name was uttered,
Mr. Utterson was already listening, but when he checked the bit of wood,
he no longer doubted it

**Mien kerd hat tem aghnuet quem ioschi proe-plangiem --** I came away
with that upon my heart, that I could have wept too

**... proeghi tetyohc pelu dwogimtias --** ... a thing that had befallen
many scores of times

The conjunction "... men (...) de ..." or "... nu (...) de ..." shows an
opposition between two sentences:

**Olivier men weict in France; Henrique de in Brasilu --** Olivier lives
*(on his side)* in France; Henrique *(for what regards him)* in Brazil

**Central ed Eust Asia nu est befolct ab mongoloids. Indonesia de
superpont uni aborigine substrat malays populations --** Central & East
Asia is populated *(on its side)* by mongoloids. Indonesia *(on its
side)* superposes Malay populations to an aborigine substrate

uni = un + i = ad un (dative singular)

"... men (...) de ..." and "... nu (...) de ..." have the very same
role.

But when "nu" is used alone, that's to say, it's not used in conjunction
with "de", it's an adverb that means "namely".

**Un public wesnum est un contracto conclus ab un contragend magh, nu id
Stat, ia regional au local autoritats --** a public procurement is a
contract concluded by a contracting authority, namely/that is to say the
State, the regional or local authorities

The enclitic affix -schi already was explained and the enclitic affix
-smee will be explained soon.

[]{#anchor-336}USEFUL AFFIXES
=============================

Differently from other auxiliary languages, Sambahsa relies more on
borrowed words than composed words. Sambahsa has so many languages as
sources that is impossible to have a regular system of derivation, but
some useful affixes can be listed.

Some basic rules can be considered in forms derived from the romance
languages, an important characteristic of theirs is that they\'re based
on the "perfect stem", which is predicted in the following ways:

For verbs ending with unstressed "e", it\'s used -at- instead.

form*e* → form*at*- → formation

For verbs ending with "ie", it\'s used -icat- instead.

publ*ie* → publ*icat-* → publication

For verbs ending with "ue", it\'s used -ut- instead. It also is applied
to verbs whose past participles in "t" ends with -wt.

constit*ue* → constitut*ut-* → constitution

For verbs ending with "eih", it\'s used -it- instead.

add*eih* → add*it-* → addition

The perfect stem of other verbs corresponds to their participles in "t".

[]{#anchor-338}SUFFIXES
-----------------------

### []{#anchor-339}EXPRESSING QUALITY OR STATE

if possible.

**Long {long} (length) --** longe {londj} (lengthiness)

**Deub {döb} (deep) --** dube {düb} (deepness)

adjective and the derived form. For other adjectives is used the suffix
-(e)t.

**Mild {mild} (mild) --** mildet {mIldët} (pity)

**Mynder {mÜndër} (proud) --** Myndert {mÜndërt} (pride)

It\'s possible the use of other affixes like -os and -ia. For words of
romance origin it\'s used -or and (i)tat.

### []{#anchor-340}EXPRESSING AN ACTION

If the own stem is not enough, the ending -(e)n may be added *(or -sa
for verbs ending with a stressed vowel sound)*. For verbs of romance
origin, it's added -(t)ion to the verbal stem.

### []{#anchor-341}INDICATING THE PERFORMER OF AN ACTION

The most used is -er, very similar to English. A practical set is -ant
for who makes the action, -eit for who suffers this action, and -at to

[]{#anchor-343}STYLE
====================

Different from the national languages, which have native speakers
inserted in a determined social context, Sambahsa is to be spoken
between people of different backgrounds. A Mongolian will not understand
very well a person who speaks in the German way, regardless of the
Sambahsa of this second person is grammatically correct, and his/her
pronunciation is perfect.

For example: you must be aware to not translate a sentence like "It\'s
necessary to repair the house" to "id est necessar urpes id dom", the
correct translation is "est necessar urpes id dom", although the better
way of expressing this idea would be "id dom tehrpt bihe urpt". Be
careful, avoid transporting anglicisms to Sambahsa.

Now let\'s see the case of the idioms, do you know what is an idiom?
It\'s a linguistic term used to describe terms that are only used in a
determined language, if they were directly translated to another
language, they won't have any sense. I\'ll show you some examples from
the French language:

**Cherchez la femme --** police slang for situations when there is a
complication and nobody knows who was responsible. In a literal
translation, it is "look for the woman"

**Pourboire --** it\'s our tip *(the extra money that we give to the
waiter)*. In direct translation, it is "for drinking".

Let\'s see a more familiar example: "Fred kicked the bucket", which
means that Fred has died. If you say "Fred kalkit id amfer" to a
Brazilian he or she will understand that Fred literally kicked a
physical bucket!

It\'s not like the idioms are untranslatable, it\'s their direct
translation that is unfeasible. Are understanding what I am trying to
say?

I am not saying that you have to speak a poor and personality‑less
Sambahsa! But you have to be aware in avoiding idioms and other forms of
speaking that are exclusive of Americans. Talk in a simple way, but
without losing the personality that the language allows us to have and
the richness that it offers us.

[]{#anchor-344}NEW WORDS
========================

This chapter briefly discusses the creation of words for the language.
There is no reason to worry about new words, Sambahsa already has a
great lexicon and new words will come from the absorption of neologisms.
If it\'s not possible a translation from the existent lexicon in
Sambahsa, it can be used the word in its original form, the terms from
the computer science area are a good example of it. For words that imply
a specific cultural item, like a martial art of a people or a typical
dish, it will be used the own word. It\'s similar to what would happen
in English, for example, the word 武術 *(wushu)* was translated in the
nearest way to what is pronounced in the original, respecting the limits
of the English language that doesn\'t have the intonations of Chinese
and other different sounds.

I notice that many people underestimate the vocabulary of Sambahsa, I
remember when I saw a man who thought that Sambahsa didn't have
translations for words like "source-code". We already have many words, a
lot of them. I admit that Sambahsa doesn't have translations for all the
medical terms created by man, but the vocabulary is very rich.

The primary source is, surely, what was reconstructed from the ancestor
(Proto-)Indo-European. As not all words were reconstructed, many of them
can be obtained from Indo-European ancient languages like Sanskrit,
Ancient Greek, and Latin.

Other sources are borrowed words from, at least, two linguistic
branches, from West Europe until East Asia.

As you can see, naturally that the new words have to be adapted to the
orthography of Sambahsa, which, due to its flexibility, tries at best to
maintain the words in their original form and original pronunciation.

[]{#anchor-345}COMMON MISTAKES AND QUESTIONS
============================================

Throughout this grammar, I\'ve tried to explain all the details of the
language, but something that was not understood by someone may always
exist. So I\'ve created this chapter for listing all the mistakes and
questions I had throughout my learning in Sambahsa. I hope that this
chapter will be useful to you.

Obviously that, in future versions of this grammar, questions of other
people will be added here.

[]{#anchor-346}HOW WORK GENERIC PRONOUNS LIKE "TO" AND "QUO"?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Words like "to" and "quo" are generic pronouns that especially refer to
already said things, they are for neutral singular
nominative/accusative. They don't suffer declension.

Henrique hat creet un nov automatic dictionar. Tod suawehrct!

Here "tod" refers to "automatic dictionar".

Henrique hat creet un nov automatic dictionar. To est un khauris khabar!

Here "to" sto the previous sentence, to the fact that Henrique has
created a new dictionary.

"To hat duren pior diu!!!!" sieyg is ob impatience.

Here "to" refers to the situation that created this impatience.

**El prient: "Volo kaupe un ieftin deluxe auto, bet ne trehvo semject
interessant in id journal".**

Serter: Est her un annunce quod correspondt quo tu paurskes

Here "quod" refers to "annunce" and "quo" refers to something that was
not said in the sentence.

Is it possible the use of more generic pronouns? In theory, would be
possible pronouns like "cio" and "eno", but they almost are never used.

[]{#anchor-347}WHAT THE VERB "LEIT" REALLY MEANS
------------------------------------------------

It means "to go, to run" in the figurative sense.

**Is vohs un armur quod baygh duslit ei --** He wore an armor that
wasn\'t good in him

**duslit = **dus (preffix for "bad" or "ill-") + lit (past tense of
"leit")

**In ielg poesis, lit meis au minter dayir pisk --** In each poetry, the
matter was more or less about fish

**Kam leitte yu? --** How are you? *(*or* "how are you going?")*

**Bet tod conversation leit lyt pior oku --** But this conversation is
going a bit very quickly

**Id grance leit engwn id Rhen --** The boundaries go along the Rhine

More examples, but with te word "uperleit":

**Hind uperleit ex un agrent societat eni un democratic quader --**
India makes the transition from an agricultural society within a
democratic framework

**Id economic crosct nilent, uperleitend ex 9% pro yar in 2010 do 6% in
2011 --** The economic growth is slowing down, passing from 9% for year
to 6% in 2011

**Mehnent maghe uperlites fauran do id politic nivell --** They think
*(they)* can pass immediately to the political level

**Serter uperlit is do id camp ios Papp --** Later, he joined the camp
of the Pope

**Ghehdt uperlites id hol territorium uns land --** It can go *(extend)*
beyond the whole territory of a country

[]{#anchor-348}HOW TO ASK SOMETHING TO SOMEONE
----------------------------------------------

How translate "I asked my father for money". The most correct
translation is *not* "prohgim denars ad mien pater", let\'s see the
problems of this sentence. The sentence in its passive form:

**\* Denars buir prohgen ab me ud mien pater --** Money was prayed to me
by my father

Remember that the verb "prehg", in the sense of "ask something to
someone" is used with the word "ke(m)" and in this case should be used
the "ud" instead "ad". Let\'s see how would be the translation of this
absurd sentence.

**\* Prohgim denars ad mien pater --** I prayed to money for my father

Now see the sentence how it should be translated:

**I asked my father for money --** Prohgim mien pater ke mi daht denars
*(**literally:** I asked my father that he give me money)*

Notice that "mi" is in the dative case

[]{#anchor-349}HOW TO SAY WHETHER SOMETHING WILL BE DELAYED OR BE LATE?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let\'s start with the verb "chitay". You can make sentences like:

**Tod saat chitayt --** This clock is late

**Id machine chitayt pre schalte --** The machine is delaying to start
*(**in direct translation:** "the machine delays before starting". You
mustn\'t use "kay" here)*

How the transitive verb "chitay" may be used with persons:

**Id seuy hat chitayt mien prient --** The rain has delayed my friend

You can use the adjective "skept".

**Mien prient est skept ob id seuy --** My friend is late due to the
rain

There are several forms of expressing an idea:

**Id machine tehrpt wakt pre biwehrge --** The machine needs time before
it start to work

[]{#anchor-350}VERBS OF DIRECTION LIKE "GWAH"
---------------------------------------------

Verbs like "gwah" (to go to) dispense prepositions because their direct
objects already inform that they are the direction of movement. The
preposition may serve to inform something more, like in the examples
below:

**Vahm gwahe kye mien dom --** I am going to my house *(I am going to
the house, but I don\'t plain to enter into it)*

**Vahm gwahe mien dom --** I am going to my house *(I enter into the
houseentro na casa)*

[]{#anchor-351}WHAT\'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "YAKIN" AND "WEIDWOS"?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

While "yakin" is an adjective, "weidwos" is an adverb.

Always pay attention in the dictionary to the grammatical
classificationof the words.

[]{#anchor-352}ABOUT MINOR GRAMMATICAL ISSUES
=============================================

[]{#anchor-353}NAMES OF LANGUAGES AND NATIONALITIES
---------------------------------------------------

Look the following text: "Did you know that Spanish is spoken by more
than five hundred million people? But there are only forty-seven million
Spaniards".

This very same text in Portuguese: "Você sabia que o espanhol é falado
por mais de quinhentos milhões de pessoas? Mas só existem quarenta e
sete milhões de espanhóis".

Notice that in English the first letter of the name of the language was
written in capital letter and didn\'t receive a definite article, the
gentile was also written in capital letter. But in Portuguese both the
name of the language and its gentile always has its first letter written
in lowercase, and the name of the language receives article.

Which model does Sambahsa follow? Both are valid, write in the way you
think is better.

**English way:** Wois(at) yu od Espaniol est baht ab meis quem penk(we)
cent millions leuden? Bet ter sont tik quargim sept millions Espaniolen

**Portuguese way:** Wois(at) yu od id espaniol est baht ab meis quem
penk(we) cent millions em leuds? Bet ter sont tik quargim sept millions
em espaniols

[]{#anchor-354}WORDS RELATED TO NUMBERS LESSER THAN TWO
-------------------------------------------------------

What\'s correct, "1,5 liter" or "1,5 liters"? In Sambahsa both are
correct.

[]{#anchor-355}VERBAL CONCORDANCE OF THE VERB "ES"
--------------------------------------------------

Look at the following sentences:

\(1) -- Id bratriya est i Purts ios Desert 

\(2) -- Id bratriya sont i Purts ios Desert

Which one would be the correct in this case, "est" or "sont"? To which
sentence the verb "es" preferably agrees, "Id bratriya" or "i Purts ios
Desert"? In such cases, if there is an element in the plural, the verb
to be used will be in the plural, therefore the correct would be (2).

Yeah, I know that the best way to write this sentence would be "id
bratriya est composen ab i Purts ios Desert", but I\'ve forced a more
informal sentence to show you what to do in situations like that.

[^3]: For those who do not know Esperanto and did not get the reference:

[^5]: The word "dangereus" {dandjërÖs} is valid because the suffix -eus
    did not change the pronunciation of the original word "danger". But
    "dangero" {dandjEro} **is** wrong.

[^6]: Since Sambahsa use commas instead *of *dots, you translate "zero

    comes from Latin "Margaritha", in the diverse languages this name
    lost some syllables:

    Greta → Gretchen → Gretel

    The original joint of letters is "margaRITa", not "GRIT", that's why
    it became "Ritka".
